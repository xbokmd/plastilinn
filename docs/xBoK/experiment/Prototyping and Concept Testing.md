    - TODO [[Prototyping and Concept Testing]]
      - TODO [[Define the scope of the prototype]]
        - Determine the key features and functionality that will be included in the prototype. This should be based on the insights gained from the problem and solution interviews.
      - TODO [[Create a basic prototype]]
        - Use prototyping tools or software to create a basic version of the product that showcases the key features and functionality. The prototype should be interactive and allow users to navigate through different screens or sections.
      - TODO [[Recruit participants for testing]]
        - Reach out to potential users or target customers and invite them to participate in the testing of the prototype. This can be done through online platforms, social media, or personal networks.
      - TODO [[Conduct user testing]]
        - Schedule testing sessions with the recruited participants. During the sessions, ask the participants to perform specific tasks or scenarios using the prototype. Observe their interactions, listen to their feedback, and take notes on any usability issues or areas for improvement.
      - TODO [[Gather feedback and insights]]
        - After each testing session, debrief with the participant and ask for their feedback on the prototype. Encourage them to share their thoughts, suggestions, and concerns. Take detailed notes on their feedback and insights.
      - TODO [[Analyze the feedback]]
        - Review the notes from the testing sessions and identify common themes or patterns in the feedback. Look for usability issues, areas of confusion, or suggestions for improvement.
      - TODO [[Make necessary adjustments]]
        - Based on the feedback received, make necessary adjustments to the prototype to address the identified usability issues or areas for improvement. This may involve refining the design, adjusting the user flow, or adding new features.
      - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
        - Create an updated version of the prototype and conduct additional testing sessions with new participants. Iterate on the design and functionality based on the feedback received.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By creating a basic prototype and testing it with users, we expect to gather valuable feedback that will help us improve the design and functionality of the product. This feedback will help us identify and address any usability issues or areas of confusion, ensuring that the final product meets the needs and preferences of the target market. The expected outcome of this experiment is to refine the prototype based on the user feedback and increase the chances of developing a successful and user-friendly product. Additionally, the testing process will help validate the product concept and provide insights for further iterations and improvements.
