      **Relevant Government Agencies**  
Focus on agencies with significant space budgets, such as:
       **NASA** (USA)
       **ESA** (European Space Agency)
       **Roscosmos** (Russia)

**Aggregated Budget Data**
       **Annual Budgets for Space Missions**:  
  Collect data on annual space budgets dedicated to satellite launches from these agencies' public budget documents or financial reports.
       **Specific Allocation for Satellite Launches**:  
  From the total space budget, identify the portion allocated specifically for satellite launches, which might include:
       Satellite development
       Launch services
       Related operations
       **Multi-Year Contracts and Commitments**:  
  Many government satellite launches are planned years in advance, with contracts awarded to launch providers like:
       **SpaceX**
       **ULA**
       **Arianespace**

**Compile and Analyze Data**

**Calculation**  
Assuming:
       NASA's budget for satellite launches in the upcoming year is $2 billion.
       ESA allocates $1 billion.
       Roscosmos, CNSA, and ISRO combined allocate another $2 billion.

The total market size for government satellite launch customers would then be approximately **$5 billion** for that year. Adjustments for inflation and long-term contracts might refine this estimate further.
