      Relevant Government Agencies
Focus on agencies with significant space budgets, such as NASA (USA), ESA (European Space Agency), Roscosmos (Russia), CNSA (China National Space Administration), and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation).

Aggregated Budget Data
       Annual Budgets for Space Missions: Collect data on annual space budgets dedicated to satellite launches from these agencies' public budget documents or financial reports.
       Specific Allocation for Satellite Launches: From the total space budget, identify the portion allocated specifically for satellite launches, which might include satellite development, launch services, and related operations.

Multi-Year Contracts and Commitments
Many government satellite launches are planned years in advance, with contracts awarded to launch providers like SpaceX, ULA, Arianespace, etc.

Compile and Analyze Data
       Aggregate Data: Sum the allocations for satellite launches across all identified government agencies to get a total market size.
       Analyze Trends: Look at historical data to identify growth trends in government spending on satellite launches, which can help project future market sizes.

Calculation
Assuming:
       NASA's budget for satellite launches in the upcoming year is $2 billion.
       ESA allocates $1 billion.
       Roscosmos, CNSA, and ISRO combined allocate another $2 billion.

The total market size for government satellite launch customers would then be approximately $5 billion for that year. Adjustments for inflation and long-term contracts might refine this estimate further.
