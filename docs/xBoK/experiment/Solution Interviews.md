    - TODO [[Solution Interviews]]
      - TODO [[Identify the target market]]
        - Define the specific segment of customers that the startup is targeting. This could be based on demographics, psychographics, or other relevant factors.
      - TODO [[Develop a list of potential customers]]
        - Create a list of individuals or organizations that fit the target market criteria. This could be done through market research, online platforms, or personal networks.
      - TODO [[Prepare interview questions]]
        - Develop a set of open-ended questions that will help gather feedback on the proposed solutions. These questions should be designed to understand the pain points, needs, and preferences of the potential customers.
      - TODO [[Conduct solution interviews]]
        - Reach out to the potential customers on the list and request their participation in an interview. The interviews can be conducted in person, over the phone, or through video calls. Explain the purpose of the interview and ensure that the participants feel comfortable providing honest feedback.
      - TODO [[Ask open-ended questions]]
        - During the interviews, ask the prepared questions to gather insights on the proposed solutions. Encourage the participants to share their thoughts, suggestions, and concerns. Take detailed notes during the interviews to capture the key points.
      - TODO [[Analyze the feedback]]
        - Review the notes from the interviews and identify common themes or patterns in the feedback. Look for recurring pain points, needs, or preferences that can help shape the proposed solutions.
      - TODO [[Iterate on the idea]]
        - Based on the feedback received, iterate on the proposed solutions to address the identified pain points and meet the needs of the target market. This could involve refining the features, adjusting the pricing, or even pivoting the business model if necessary.
      - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
        - Conduct additional solution interviews with new potential customers to gather more feedback on the refined solutions. This iterative process will help validate the model of the business and ensure continuous improvement.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By conducting solution interviews and gathering feedback from potential customers, the startup will gain valuable insights into the market needs and preferences. This feedback will help validate the model of the business and ensure that the proposed solutions are aligned with the target market. The expected outcome of this experiment is to refine the solutions based on the feedback received and increase the chances of success for the startup. Additionally, the startup will build a stronger understanding of the target market and develop relationships with potential customers, which can lead to future partnerships or sales opportunities.
