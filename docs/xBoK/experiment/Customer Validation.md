    - TODO [[Customer Validation]]
      - TODO [[Create a minimum viable product (MVP)]]
        - Develop a simplified version of the product that can be used to gather feedback and test the market demand. The MVP should have enough features to provide value to customers and allow them to experience the core benefits of the product.
      - TODO [[Identify potential customers]]
        - Define the specific segment of customers that the product is targeting. This could be based on demographics, psychographics, or other relevant factors.
      - TODO [[Reach out to potential customers]]
        - Use various marketing and sales channels to reach out to potential customers and generate interest in the product. This could include online advertising, social media campaigns, email marketing, or direct sales outreach.
      - TODO [[Offer the product for sale]]
        - Make the MVP available for purchase or use by potential customers. This could involve setting up an online store, offering a free trial, or providing early access to a limited number of customers.
      - TODO [[Collect feedback and data]]
        - Engage with customers who have purchased or used the product and gather feedback on their experience. This could be done through surveys, interviews, or user testing sessions. Collect data on customer satisfaction, usage patterns, and any issues or suggestions they may have.
      - TODO [[Analyze the feedback and data]]
        - Review the feedback and data collected from customers and identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. Look for common pain points, positive experiences, or suggestions that can help refine the product and enhance the customer experience.
      - TODO [[Iterate on the product]]
        - Based on the feedback and data analysis, make necessary adjustments and improvements to the product. This could involve adding new features, addressing usability issues, or refining the pricing and packaging.
      - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
        - Continue to engage with customers, collect feedback, and iterate on the product. This iterative process will help validate the market demand, refine the product-market fit, and increase the chances of success for the business.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By conducting customer validation and obtaining early sales and feedback, the startup will confirm that the target market is willing to buy the product. This validation will provide valuable insights into the market demand and help refine the product to better meet the needs of customers. Additionally, the early sales and feedback will help build credibility and attract more customers, leading to further growth and success for the business.
