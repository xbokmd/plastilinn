- ## üìñ Description
  The concept of Funding Sources in business modeling refers to the diverse ways a business model generates revenue or acquires capital to support its operations. This concept is crucial as it directly impacts the financial sustainability and growth potential of a business.
  
  Funding Sources can be broadly categorized into two types: internal and external. Internal funding sources are generated within the business and include revenues from sales, profits retained in the business, and depreciation provisions. These sources are typically recurring and are closely linked to the business's operational performance.
  
  External funding sources, on the other hand, are funds obtained from outside the business. These can include equity capital from shareholders, loans from financial institutions, grants, and subsidies from government bodies, and investments from venture capitalists or angel investors. External funding sources are often used for significant business expansion or development projects.
  
  The choice of funding sources depends on various factors such as the business's stage of development, its financial health, the nature of its operations, and its strategic objectives. For instance, a startup might rely heavily on external funding sources like venture capital and angel investment, while a mature business might primarily use its internal funding sources.
  
  The Funding Sources model is a vital part of business design as it determines how a business finances its operations, invests in growth, and manages financial risks. It also influences other aspects of the business model, such as the value proposition, customer segments, and cost structure.
  
  For example, a software company might generate revenue through subscription fees (an internal funding source) and also raise capital through a series of funding rounds with venture capitalists (an external funding source). These funding sources would support the company's operations, fund its growth initiatives, and shape its business model.
  
  In summary, the Funding Sources model provides a framework for identifying, evaluating, and managing the various ways a business generates revenue or acquires capital. It is a critical component of business design, influencing the business's financial sustainability, growth potential, and overall business strategy.

- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "revenue streams" is one of the nine key components. This refers to the ways a company generates income from each customer segment. It includes all the methods of generating revenue, which could be through direct sales, licensing, subscription fees, advertising, etc. This component is closely related to the funding sources of a business model.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of existing funding sources and to identify new opportunities or threats in the realm of finance. For example, a strength could be a reliable source of funding, while a threat could be a potential change in the economic environment that could affect funding.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - The PESTEL analysis can help identify how external factors affect a company's funding sources. For example, changes in economic conditions can affect the availability of funding, while changes in legal regulations can affect the types of funding a company can access.
  - [[Porter's Five Forces]]
    - This tool can be used to analyze the competitive environment and its impact on a company's funding sources. For example, the bargaining power of buyers could affect a company's revenue, while the threat of new entrants could affect a company's market share and thus its revenue.
  - [[Financial Projections]]
    - Financial projections, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, are essential tools for planning and managing a company's funding sources. They provide a detailed view of a company's financial situation and can help identify potential funding gaps.
  - [[Venture Capital Method]]
    - This method is used by venture capitalists to estimate the value of a company and thus determine the amount of funding they are willing to provide. It takes into account the expected future profits of the company, the exit value of the company, and the level of risk associated with the investment.
  - [[Crowdfunding Platforms]]
    - Platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe have become popular tools for businesses to raise funds. These platforms allow businesses to reach a large number of potential investors and provide a platform for showcasing their business ideas and products.
