## üìñ Description
  The concept of "Competition" in business modeling refers to the analysis and understanding of other businesses that offer similar products or services in the same market. This involves identifying who these competitors are, understanding their strategies, strengths, and weaknesses, and determining how they could potentially impact your business.
  
  In the "Competition" model, businesses use various tools and techniques to gather and analyze information about their competitors. This could involve conducting market research, analyzing competitors' marketing strategies, assessing their product offerings, and monitoring their pricing strategies. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the competitive landscape and to identify opportunities and threats.
  
  For example, a new restaurant might analyze the competition in its local area to understand what types of cuisine are already being offered, what price points are common, and what unique selling propositions other restaurants are promoting. This information could then be used to develop a unique and competitive business model that fills a gap in the market.
  
  Alternatively, a tech startup might analyze the competition in its industry to understand the key features and benefits of competing products, the marketing strategies being used, and the overall market share of different competitors. This information could then be used to develop a product that offers unique features or benefits, or to create a marketing strategy that differentiates the startup from its competitors.
  
  The "Competition" concept in business modeling is crucial because it helps businesses to understand the competitive landscape and to develop strategies that will allow them to compete effectively. This can lead to increased market share, customer loyalty, and ultimately, business success.

## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "competition" is not explicitly mentioned but is an integral part of the "market forces" in the environment map. This includes the competitive landscape, market segments, needs and demands, market issues, and switching costs. Understanding the competition helps in defining the value proposition and customer segments.
  - [[Porter's Five Forces]]
    - This tool, developed by Michael Porter, is specifically designed to analyze the competitive environment of a business. It includes the analysis of the threat of new entrants, the threat of substitute products or services, the bargaining power of customers, the bargaining power of suppliers, and the intensity of competitive rivalry.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a business in relation to its competition. Opportunities and threats in the competitive landscape can also be identified.
  - [[Competitive Positioning Model]]
    - This model helps a business to identify its competitive advantage in its market segment. It involves understanding the competition, and then differentiating oneself by providing superior value.
  - [[Value Net Model]]
    - Developed by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff, this model looks at business competition and cooperation. It identifies four types of players in the competitive game: Customers, Suppliers, Competitors, and Complementors. Understanding these players helps in strategizing and creating value.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - This strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, involves creating a new, uncontested market space (or "Blue Ocean") rather than competing in an existing market, which is often saturated and highly competitive ("Red Ocean").
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - The PESTEL analysis can help identify how external factors might affect the competition within a market segment. For example, changes in legal regulations might affect the competitive landscape.
