## üìñ Description
  The concept of "Person/Inputs" in business modeling refers to the specific individuals or resources that contribute to the value creation process within a business model. These inputs are not just random elements, but carefully identified individuals or resources that have a direct impact on the business operations and outcomes.
  
  In a business model, "Person/Inputs" are fundamental components as they are the key contributors to the execution of the business activities. They are responsible for carrying out specific tasks or providing necessary resources, and their performance or quality directly impacts the success of the business.
  
  The identification of "Person/Inputs" can vary depending on the nature of the business and the tasks at hand. It can include different roles such as employees, suppliers, partners, or even customers. Each identified person or input has a specific role and responsibilities, and they all need to work together in a coordinated manner to achieve the business goals.
  
  For example, in a manufacturing business, the "Person/Inputs" might include roles such as production manager, machine operators, raw material suppliers, and quality control inspectors. Each of these roles is crucial for the business to produce and deliver high-quality products to the customers.
  
  The concept of "Person/Inputs" in business modeling is not just about identifying the people or resources involved in the business operations. It's about understanding their roles, responsibilities, and contributions to the value creation process. It's about creating a system where these inputs can effectively collaborate to achieve the business goals.
  
  In conclusion, the "Person/Inputs" concept in business modeling is a critical element that contributes to the effective execution of the business activities and the achievement of the business goals. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and understanding the key contributors to the value creation process in a business model.

  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "Key Resources" and "Key Activities" are two of the nine key components that directly relate to the "Person/Inputs" in a business model. Key Resources refers to the most important assets required to make a business model work, which can include human resources or individuals contributing to the value creation process. Key Activities, on the other hand, are the most important things a company must do to make its business model work, which can also involve the tasks performed by individuals.
  - [[Value Chain Analysis]]
    - This tool, developed by Michael Porter, is used to analyze the activities that a company performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service. The "Primary Activities" in the value chain, such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, all involve the contribution of individuals or resources to the value creation process.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the individuals or resources contributing to the value creation process, as well as to identify opportunities for improvement or potential threats.
  - [[Resource-Based View (RBV)]]
    - The Resource-Based View is a method for analyzing and identifying a firm's strategic advantages based on the examination of its unique bundle of resources and capabilities. This includes the individuals or resources that contribute to the value creation process.
  - [[Balanced Scorecard]]
    - The Balanced Scorecard is a strategic planning and management system that organizations use to align business activities to the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. It includes perspectives such as "Learning and Growth" which focuses on employee training and corporate cultural attitudes related to both individual and corporate self-improvement.
  - [[Six Sigma]]
    - Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It seeks to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of quality management methods, mainly empirical, statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization who are experts in these methods.
