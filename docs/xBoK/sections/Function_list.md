## üìñ Description
  The concept of "Function List" in business modeling refers to a high-level specification of the tasks that are necessary to carry out a business activity towards the achievement of a business goal. This list is a crucial component of a business model as it outlines the key functions or tasks that need to be performed to deliver a product or service, create value for customers, and achieve the business objectives.
  
  The function list is typically organized in a logical sequence, starting from the initial stages of the business process to the final stages. Each function or task in the list is clearly defined and includes details such as the resources required, the expected output, and the responsible party or department.
  
  For example, in a manufacturing business, the function list might include tasks such as sourcing raw materials, production, quality control, packaging, distribution, and customer service. Each of these tasks is essential for the business to produce and deliver its products to the customers.
  
  The function list is not just a to-do list; it is a strategic tool that helps businesses to plan and manage their operations efficiently. It allows businesses to identify the key activities that drive value creation and focus their resources and efforts on these activities. It also helps to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the business process and find ways to improve them.
  
  Moreover, the function list can be used as a communication tool to clarify roles and responsibilities within the organization and ensure that everyone understands what needs to be done to achieve the business goals.
  
  In conclusion, the "Function List" concept in business modeling is a vital tool that helps businesses to plan, manage, and optimize their operations towards the achievement of their business goals.

## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)]]
    - BPMN is a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a business process model. It provides businesses with a standard method of illustrating the flow of activities (functions) in a process, making it easier to understand and improve.
  - [[Value Stream Mapping]]
    - This lean-management method is used for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer. It helps to visualize and understand the flow of material and information as a product or service makes its way through the value stream.
  - [[Gantt Chart]]
    - A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity.
  - [[Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)]]
    - WBS is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) defines the work breakdown structure as a "hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables."
  - [[Critical Path Method (CPM)]]
    - CPM is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities. It is a step-by-step project management technique to identify activities on the critical path. It is an approach to project scheduling that allows the project manager to manage the trade-off between the time and cost necessary to complete the project.
  - [[Lean Six Sigma]]
    - Lean Six Sigma is a method that relies on a collaborative team effort to improve performance by systematically removing waste and reducing variation. It combines lean manufacturing/lean enterprise and Six Sigma to eliminate the eight kinds of waste: Defects, Over-Production, Waiting, Non-Utilized Talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, and Extra-Processing.
