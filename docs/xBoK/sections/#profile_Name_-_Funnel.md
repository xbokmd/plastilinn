- ## üìñ Description
  The concept of "profile/funnel" in business modeling refers to the process that a customer goes through in their journey with a company, from the initial point of contact to the final action or conversion. This process is often visualized as a funnel due to the decreasing number of customers at each step.
  
  Each step in the funnel represents a specific action that the customer takes in relation to the company. For example, the first step might be visiting the company's website, the second step could be clicking on a product for more information, the third step might be adding the product to the shopping cart, and the final step would be purchasing the product.
  
  The "profile" part of the concept refers to the identification of the customer at each step. This could be based on various factors such as their browsing behavior, purchase history, demographic information, and more. The profile helps the company to understand who their customers are and what they are interested in, which can inform their marketing and sales strategies.
  
  The "funnel" part of the concept refers to the percentage of customers who move from one step to the next. This is a key metric for understanding the effectiveness of the company's customer journey and identifying areas for improvement. For example, if a large percentage of customers drop off at the shopping cart stage, this could indicate a problem with the checkout process that needs to be addressed.
  
  In essence, the concept of "profile/funnel" in business modeling is about understanding and optimizing the customer journey. It provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, and helps the company to make data-driven decisions to improve customer engagement and conversion rates. This is a crucial aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the company's bottom line.

  - [[Sales Funnel]]
    - The Sales Funnel is a classic business modeling tool that directly reflects the customer's journey with the company. It starts with the total number of potential customers and ends with the final conversion into a sale. Each step in the funnel represents a stage in the customer's decision-making process, with the percentage of people moving to the next stage typically decreasing at each step.
  
  - [[Conversion Funnel]]
    - Similar to the Sales Funnel, the Conversion Funnel is a tool used to understand the journey of a customer towards the completion of a goal, which could be a purchase, a subscription, or any other action. It helps businesses identify where in the process potential customers are dropping off and thus provides insights into how to improve the conversion rate.
  
  - [[Customer Journey Map]]
    - While the Customer Journey Map is a more holistic tool that covers all interactions between the customer and the company, it can also be used to understand the funnel. By mapping out each touchpoint, businesses can identify the steps in the funnel and the percentage of customers moving from one step to the next.
  
  - [[AARRR Metrics (Pirate Metrics)]]
    - This model, developed by Dave McClure, breaks down the customer lifecycle into five key stages: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue (AARRR). Each stage can be seen as a step in the funnel, with the percentage of customers moving to the next stage being a key metric at each step.
  
  - [[Lean Canvas]]
    - The Lean Canvas, a variant of the Business Model Canvas, includes a focus on the problem-solution fit and the unique value proposition. While it doesn't explicitly include a funnel, understanding these aspects can help businesses design their funnel more effectively by aligning it with the customer's needs and the company's unique offering. 
  
  - [[Growth Funnel]]
    - The Growth Funnel is a business modeling tool that focuses on growth strategies. It breaks down the growth process into stages, similar to a funnel, and helps businesses identify strategies to move customers from one stage to the next, thus driving growth.
