  The concept of "Founders" in business modeling refers to the individuals who establish and initiate a business venture, taking on the role of its originators. These are the people who bring the business idea to life, taking the initial risk and responsibility for its success or failure. 
  
  Founders are typically involved in all aspects of the business, from conceptualizing the idea, to planning and executing the business model, to managing the day-to-day operations. They are often the driving force behind the business, providing the vision, leadership, and strategic direction that guides its growth and development.
  
  In the context of business modeling, the role of the founders is crucial. They are the ones who define the business's mission, values, and goals, and they shape the business model that will be used to achieve these objectives. They also play a key role in attracting and securing resources, such as capital, talent, and partnerships, which are necessary for the business to operate and grow.
  
  The concept of "Founders" is also important in understanding the dynamics and relationships within the business. Founders often have a significant influence on the culture and values of the business, and their leadership style can impact the behavior and performance of other stakeholders. 
  
  In conclusion, the concept of "Founders" is a key element in business design and modeling. It highlights the role of the individuals who initiate and drive the business venture, and it provides a framework for understanding their influence on the business model, the resources, and the culture of the business.
