# Components


## üîç Definition
Technologies and components that are part of the final solution, that is, the product or service offered to the customer to solve their problem. For example, the programming language used, the cloud platform used, or the parts that are part of the... in the case of being a physical product.

## üìñ Description
  The concept of "solution/components" in business modeling refers to the various technologies and components that make up the final product or service that a company offers to its customers. These components are the building blocks that work together to solve a customer's problem or meet their needs.
  
  The "solution" part of the concept refers to the unique identifier of the final product or service. This could be a specific model of a product, a version of a software, or a type of service. The solution is what the customer interacts with and what ultimately delivers the value that the customer is seeking.
  
  The "components" part of the concept refers to the different technologies and parts that make up the solution. For example, in the case of a software product, the components could include the programming language used, the cloud platform on which it's hosted, the database system used, and so on. In the case of a physical product, the components could be the different parts that make up the product.
  
  Each component plays a crucial role in the functionality and performance of the solution. Therefore, it's important to carefully select and manage these components to ensure that they work together effectively to deliver a high-quality solution.
  
  In essence, the concept of "solution/components" in business modeling is about understanding and managing the building blocks of a product or service. It provides a framework for designing and optimizing the solution, and helps the company to make informed decisions about the technologies and components to use. This is a key aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the quality of the product or service and the value it delivers to customers.

## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "Key Resources" can be interpreted as the technologies and components that are part of the final solution. These resources could be physical, intellectual, human, or financial. For instance, the programming language used, the cloud platform used, or the parts that are part of the product in the case of being a physical product.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, focuses on the value proposition of a business, which is closely related to the solution offered to the customer. The "Products & Services" section of the canvas refers to the specific solutions a company offers to meet the customer's needs. This includes the technologies and components used to create these solutions.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies and components used in the solution. It can also help identify opportunities for improvement or potential threats, such as emerging technologies that could make the current solution obsolete.
  - [[Technology Roadmap]]
    - This strategic tool is used to plan and coordinate the use of technologies within a business. It can be used to map out the technologies and components that are part of the solution, and to plan for future technological developments.
  - [[Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)]]
    - This project management tool is used to break down a product into its component parts. It can be used to identify and understand all the components that make up the solution, including technologies and other resources.
  - [[Porter's Value Chain]]
    - This tool analyzes a company's activities to understand the sources of value. The "Technology Development" and "Operations" sections can provide insights into the technologies and components used in the solution.
