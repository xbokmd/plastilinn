    - #goal [[Validate or invalidate the key assumptions underlying the business idea]]
    - #goal [[Identify potential risks and uncertainties]]
  - ### Hypothesis
    - By identifying and testing the key assumptions underlying the business idea, we will gain insights into their validity and potential risks. This will help us make_informed decisions and mitigate uncertainties.

    - TODO [[Assumption Testing]]
      - TODO [[Identify the key assumptions]]
        - List out the assumptions that are critical to the success of the business idea. These could include assumptions about the target market, customer behavior, competitive landscape, or technological feasibility.
      - TODO [[Design targeted experiments]]
        - Develop experiments or tests that can validate or invalidate the identified assumptions. These experiments should be designed to gather data and insights that can_inform decision-making.
      - TODO [[Execute the experiments]]
        - Conduct the planned experiments and collect relevant data. This could involve surveys, interviews, prototype testing, market research, or other methods depending on the nature of the assumptions being tested.
      - TODO [[Analyze the results]]
        - Review the data collected from the experiments and analyze the results. Look for patterns, trends, or unexpected findings that can provide insights into the validity of the assumptions and potential risks.
      - TODO [[Validate or invalidate assumptions]]
        - Based on the analysis of the results, determine whether the assumptions have been validated or invalidated. If an assumption is validated, it provides confidence in the business idea. If an assumption is invalidated, it highlights potential risks or the need for adjustments to the idea.
      - TODO [[Iterate on the business idea]]
        - Use the insights gained from the assumption testing to refine the business idea. This may involve adjusting the value proposition, target market, business model, or other elements based on the validated or invalidated assumptions.
      - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
        - Continuously test and validate assumptions as the business idea evolves. This iterative process will help reduce uncertainties, mitigate risks, and increase the chances of success.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By conducting assumption testing, the startup will gain insights into the validity of the key assumptions underlying the business idea. This will help identify potential risks and uncertainties, allowing for_informed decision-making and adjustments to the idea. The expected outcome of this experiment is to reduce uncertainties, mitigate risks, and increase the chances of developing a successful and sustainable startup. Additionally, the startup will build a stronger understanding of the target market and customer behavior, which can_inform future strategies and decisions.
