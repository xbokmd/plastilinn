  The company uses biotechnology and genetic engineering to revive extinct animals and sell their meat in the luxury food market. The business model is based on several key components:

Research and development: The company invests in scientific research and technological development to understand and manipulate the DNA of extinct animals. They employ biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques to reconstruct the genomes of these species and recreate their distinctive characteristics.

Cloning and reproduction: Once the complete genome of an extinct animal has been obtained, the company uses cloning and assisted reproduction techniques to create living individuals of the species. This involves transferring the reconstructed DNA to stem cells or eggs of related living animals, such as elephants or cows, to produce embryos that are then implanted into surrogate females for gestation.

Care and maintenance: The company establishes facilities and care centers to house and breed the revived extinct animals. They employ veterinary and biology specialists to ensure that the animals are well taken care of and provided with an appropriate environment for their development.

Production and marketing of luxury meat: Once the animals have reached maturity, the company proceeds with meat production. The animals are ethically and respectfully slaughtered following established standards. The meat is processed, packaged with high-quality standards, and then marketed in the luxury food market. The company focuses on attracting consumers willing to pay a premium price for an exclusive and unique gastronomic experience.

Marketing and sales: The company implements marketing strategies to promote the story and value of its products, highlighting its innovative and sustainable approach. They use selective sales channels, such as high-end restaurants and specialized stores, to reach their target audience.

Sustainability and regulation: The company is committed to operating sustainably and ethically. They collaborate with experts in biodiversity conservation and work closely with regulatory authorities to ensure that their activities comply with all legal and ethical regulations related to biotechnology and genetic engineering.

It's important to note that the viability and acceptance of this business model may be subject to ethical, environmental, and regulatory considerations. Furthermore, the commercialization of meat from extinct species raises challenges and ethical issues related to biodiversity conservation and respect for animal life.
