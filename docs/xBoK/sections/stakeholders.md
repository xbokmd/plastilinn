- ## 📖 Description
  In business modeling, "stakeholders" refer to any individual, group, or organization that has an interest in, or is affected by, the activities and outcomes of a business. Stakeholders can be internal or external to the business, and their interests and influence can vary significantly. 
  
  - Internal Stakeholders: These are individuals or groups within the organization, such as employees, managers, and shareholders. They are directly involved in the operations and decision-making processes of the business. Their interests typically revolve around job security, profitability, and the growth and success of the business.
  
  - External Stakeholders: These are individuals or groups outside of the organization that are affected by its activities. They can include customers, suppliers, investors, competitors, government agencies, and the community at large. Their interests can range from product quality and customer service to environmental impact and corporate social responsibility.
  
  Stakeholder modeling is a crucial aspect of business design as it helps identify the needs, expectations, and potential conflicts of various stakeholders. This understanding can then be used to develop strategies and make decisions that balance these diverse interests. 
  
  For example, a business may need to balance the interests of shareholders seeking higher profits with those of local community groups advocating for environmental sustainability. By understanding and considering the perspectives of both these stakeholders, the business can develop a strategy that maximizes profitability while also demonstrating a commitment to environmental responsibility. 
  
  In essence, stakeholders are a fundamental part of any business model, and their engagement and satisfaction are key to the long-term success and sustainability of a business.
