## üìñ Description
  The concept of "solution/offerings" in business modeling refers to the specific products, services, or processes that a business provides to its customers in order to fulfill their needs or solve their problems. This concept is at the heart of a business's value proposition and is a crucial element in establishing its competitive advantage.
  
  In this model, a solution serves as a unique identifier for a product, service, or process. This could be a product SKU, a service ID, or a process ID. This solution is utilized to track, manage, and analyze all activities related to that specific product, service, or process.
  
  The solution is designed to address a specific problem or meet a specific need of the customers. It could be a tangible product, such as a smartphone or a car, an intangible service, such as a software subscription or a consulting service, or a process, such as a supply chain process or a customer service process.
  
  For instance, in a technology company, the solution could be a software product that assists businesses in managing their customer relationships. The company can use this solution to track the sales, usage, and performance of the software, understand the needs and preferences of its customers, and continuously improve the software to better meet the needs of its customers.
  
  In a consulting firm, the solution could be a consulting service that assists businesses in improving their operations. The firm can use this solution to track the delivery, outcomes, and satisfaction of the service, understand the problems and needs of its clients, and continuously improve the service to better solve the problems of its clients.
  
  In summary, the solution model is a potent tool for businesses to create value for their customers, differentiate themselves from their competitors, and drive their growth. It is a key component of business design and a critical driver of business success.

## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "value proposition" is one of the nine key components. This refers to the products or services that a business offers to meet the needs of its customers. The value proposition is essentially the solution or offering that the business provides, and it should be designed to solve a customer problem or fulfill a customer need in a way that is unique and compelling compared to competitors.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is specifically designed to help businesses design compelling value propositions. The "products and services" section of the canvas is where businesses identify the specific offerings that will help customers complete jobs or tasks, solve problems, or satisfy needs.
  - [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
    - The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, emphasizes the importance of getting a "minimum viable product" (MVP) into the hands of customers as quickly as possible. The MVP is a version of the product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - This strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, encourages businesses to create new demand in uncontested market spaces (or "blue oceans") rather than competing in existing markets. One way to do this is by offering a dramatically different solution or offering that creates a new market.
  - [[Jobs to be Done Theory]]
    - This theory, developed by Clayton Christensen, suggests that customers "hire" products or services to do specific "jobs" for them. By understanding what job a customer needs done, businesses can design solutions or offerings that do that job better than any other product on the market.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - While SWOT analysis is a more general tool, it can be used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a company's offerings, as well as identify opportunities for new solutions or threats from competitors' offerings.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can identify how these external factors might affect their offerings. For example, technological advancements can offer opportunities for new or improved products or services.
