        Cost Savings from Reusability
SpaceX's reusable rocket technology can reduce launch costs by a significant margin compared to traditional single-use rockets. If, for example, the average cost of launching a traditional rocket is around $150 million, SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches can cost significantly less, around $62 million or even lower for customers willing to fly on a reused booster. This represents a potential cost reduction of over 50%.

Increased Payload Efficiency
With the Falcon Heavy and the upcoming Starship, SpaceX can deliver payloads to orbit at a cost of approximately $1,500 to $2,000 per kilogram, a substantial reduction from the historical average of $10,000 to $20,000 per kilogram with traditional launch providers.

Ride-Share Program Savings
By opting for a ride-share mission, space agencies can launch small satellites for as low as $1 million, depending on the payload size and orbit, compared to the tens of millions it would typically cost for a dedicated launch.
