- ## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "segment/market size" refers to the identification and quantification of a specific group of potential customers within a market that a company aims to reach with its products or services. This segment is typically defined by certain characteristics such as age, income, geography, or behavior, which the company believes will make these customers more likely to purchase its offerings.
  
  The market size, on the other hand, is the total number of potential customers or the total revenue potential within the identified segment. It provides an estimate of the maximum potential that a business can hope to achieve if it were to capture the entire market segment.
  
  For example, a company that produces organic baby food might identify its market segment as health-conscious parents of infants and toddlers. The market size would then be determined by the total number of such parents, or alternatively, the total amount they spend on baby food annually.
  
  The concept of "segment/market size" is crucial in business modeling as it helps a company to focus its resources on the most promising customers, tailor its offerings to meet their specific needs, and estimate the potential revenue it can generate. It is a fundamental aspect of business design, shaping the company's marketing strategy, product development, and overall business strategy. It influences how the company positions itself in the market, competes with other businesses, and achieves its financial goals.

  ### Space X
  Relevant Government Agencies
  Focus on agencies with significant space budgets, such as NASA (USA), ESA (European Space Agency), Roscosmos (Russia), CNSA (China National Space Administration), and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation).
  
  Aggregated Budget Data
  - Annual Budgets for Space Missions: Collect data on annual space budgets dedicated to satellite launches from these agencies' public budget documents or financial reports.
  - Specific Allocation for Satellite Launches: From the total space budget, identify the portion allocated specifically for satellite launches, which might include satellite development, launch services, and related operations.
  
  Multi-Year Contracts and Commitments
  Many government satellite launches are planned years in advance, with contracts awarded to launch providers like SpaceX, ULA, Arianespace, etc.
  
  Compile and Analyze Data
  - Aggregate Data: Sum the allocations for satellite launches across all identified government agencies to get a total market size.
  - Analyze Trends: Look at historical data to identify growth trends in government spending on satellite launches, which can help project future market sizes.
  
  Calculation
  Assuming:
  - NASA's budget for satellite launches in the upcoming year is $2 billion.
  - ESA allocates $1 billion.
  - Roscosmos, CNSA, and ISRO combined allocate another $2 billion.
  
  The total market size for government satellite launch customers would then be approximately $5 billion for that year. Adjustments for inflation and long-term contracts might refine this estimate further.
