## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "profile/value proposition" refers to the unique combination of products or services that a company offers to meet the specific needs of a particular customer segment. It is the unique value that a company promises to deliver to its customers, and the reason why customers should choose this company over its competitors. 
  
  The profile/value proposition is a critical component of business design as it defines the company's competitive advantage, shapes its business strategy, and drives its business operations. It is the foundation of a company's relationship with its customers and the key to its market success.
  
  For instance, a software company may offer a unique value proposition to its business customers by providing innovative, reliable, and user-friendly software solutions that help businesses improve their productivity, reduce their costs, and grow their revenues. The company may also offer superior customer service, technical support, and training to ensure that its customers can fully utilize its software and achieve their business goals.
  
  The software company's value proposition is not just about its software. It is about the total value that the company delivers to its customers, including the quality of its software, the benefits that its software brings to its customers, and the support that the company provides to its customers. It is about how the company solves its customers' problems, meets their needs, and creates value for them.
  
  In essence, the profile/value proposition is a strategic tool that enables businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, attract and retain their customers, and achieve their business goals. It is the heart of business design and a key driver of business success.


## üëâ Examples
  ### Space X
  üíé#value Cost Reduction through Reusability
  
  SpaceX's pioneering development of reusable rocket technology dramatically reduces the cost of access to space. This reusability factor allows space agencies to allocate their budgets more efficiently, potentially enabling more missions or greater scope within existing financial constraints.
  SpaceX's reusable rocket technology can reduce launch costs by a significant margin compared to traditional single-use rockets. If, for example, the average cost of launching a traditional rocket is around $150 million, SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches can cost significantly less, around $62 million or even lower for customers willing to fly on a reused booster. This represents a potential cost reduction of over 50%.
  
  üíé#value Advanced Payload Capabilities
  
  SpaceX's Falcon Heavy and the forthcoming Starship are designed to carry heavy payloads to orbit, offering space agencies the ability to launch larger, more complex satellites or deep-space probes. This capability supports a wide range of missions, from Earth observation to interplanetary exploration.
  With the Falcon Heavy and the upcoming Starship, SpaceX can deliver payloads to orbit at a cost of approximately $1,500 to $2,000 per kilogram, a substantial reduction from the historical average of $10,000 to $20,000 per kilogram with traditional launch providers.
  
  üíé#value Increased Launch Flexibility and Frequency
  
  With a fleet of reusable rockets and a streamlined launch process, SpaceX can offer more frequent and flexible launch windows. This responsiveness to client scheduling needs ensures that space agencies can launch missions in a timely manner, essential for time-sensitive scientific research or satellite deployments.
  
  üíé#value End-to-End Service
  
  SpaceX provides comprehensive service offerings, including launch services, satellite deployment, mission planning, and even potential participation in groundbreaking projects like Mars colonization. This end-to-end service model simplifies the procurement process and provides a single point of accountability for space agencies.

## üóÑÔ∏è Topics
  


## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Value Proposition" is one of the nine key components. It refers to the unique combination of products and services that a company offers to its customers. The value proposition should be designed in a way that it solves a problem or fulfills a need of the customer, making it the main reason for a customer to choose one company over another.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is specifically designed to help businesses understand their customers' needs and design a value proposition that meets those needs. It consists of two parts: the customer profile and the value map. The customer profile describes the jobs, pains, and gains of a specific customer segment, while the value map describes how the company's products and services create value for this customer segment.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - The Blue Ocean Strategy is a business theory that suggests companies are better off searching for ways to play in uncontested market spaces (Blue Oceans) rather than competing with similar businesses in an existing industry (Red Oceans). One of the key tools in this strategy is the "Value Curve", which is a graphical depiction of a company's relative performance across its industry's factors of competition. This tool can help a company to design a unique value proposition that differentiates it from its competitors.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can also be used to evaluate a company's value proposition. Strengths and weaknesses can highlight aspects of the value proposition that are working well or need improvement, while opportunities and threats can identify external factors that could affect the value proposition in the future.
  - [[Jobs to be Done]]
    - This theory, developed by Clayton Christensen, suggests that customers hire products and services to do specific jobs. By understanding what job a customer needs to get done, a company can design a value proposition that perfectly fits this job. This approach can lead to highly differentiated and customer-centric value propositions.
