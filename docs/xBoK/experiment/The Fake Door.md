  - ### #[[goal]]
    - #goal [[Gauge consumer interest in the product]]
    - #goal [[Validate the demand for the product]]
  - ### Hypothesis
    - By creating a fake door, such as a landing page or an ad, we can measure consumer interest in the product. If a large number of people "click on the fake door", it may indicate a demand for the product.

  - ### #[[work]]
    - TODO [[Create the fake door]]
      - Design and create a landing page or an ad that presents the product as if it were already available for purchase or use. This could include product descriptions, images, pricing_information, and a call-to-action button.
    - TODO [[Promote the fake door]]
      - Share the landing page or ad through various channels such as social media, online forums, or targeted advertising. Drive traffic to the fake door to generate interest and measure consumer response.
    - TODO [[Track consumer interactions]]
      - Use analytics tools or tracking codes to monitor the number of clicks, conversions, or other relevant metrics on the fake door. This data will help measure consumer interest and validate the demand for the product.
    - TODO [[Analyze the data]]
      - Review the data collected from the fake door and identify patterns or trends. Look for a significant number of clicks or conversions, which may indicate a demand for the product. Analyze the demographic or behavioral characteristics of the users who interacted with the fake door to gain insights into the target market.
    - TODO [[Iterate on the product]]
      - Based on the data and insights gained from the fake door experiment, make adjustments or improvements to the product to better meet the needs and preferences of the target market. This could involve refining the features, adjusting the pricing, or even pivoting the product concept if necessary.
    - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
      - Create new iterations of the fake door experiment to validate the demand for the product and gather more insights from potential customers. This iterative process will help refine the product and increase its chances of success in the market.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By creating a fake door and measuring consumer interactions, the startup will be able to gauge the level of interest and demand for the product. If a significant number of people "click on the fake door", it may indicate a strong demand and validate the market opportunity. The expected outcome of this experiment is to gather data and insights that will_inform the development and refinement of the product. Additionally, it will help the startup make_informed decisions about the target market, pricing, and marketing strategies.
