- ## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "vision" refers to the aspirational image or goal that a business aims to achieve in the future. It is a forward-looking statement that provides a clear direction for the organization's growth and development. The vision is typically expressed in a vision statement, which is a brief, inspiring declaration of the business's long-term objectives.
  
  The vision is a vital component of a business model as it sets the business's strategic direction and guides its decision-making processes. It communicates what the business aspires to become, who it aims to serve, and how it intends to evolve to provide greater value to its customers or clients. The vision also serves as an inspirational tool, motivating employees and stakeholders to strive towards the shared goal.
  
  For example, the vision of a technology company might be "to revolutionize the way people interact with technology." This vision guides the company's innovation and product development efforts, and it communicates to stakeholders - including investors, employees, and customers - what the company is aiming to achieve.
  
  In essence, the concept of "vision" in business modeling is about defining and articulating the long-term goals of a business. It is a critical element in business design, providing strategic direction, inspiration, and a framework for decision-making, and shaping the business's growth and development strategies.

  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the vision is not explicitly represented as one of the nine key components. However, it is an underlying element that guides the overall design of the business model. The vision helps to define the value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure.
  - [[Balanced Scorecard]]
    - The Balanced Scorecard is a strategic planning and management system that organizations use to align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization. It provides a framework to translate a strategy into operational terms, thus reflecting the vision of the organization.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate the alignment of the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats with its vision. A vision that leverages the company's strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats can be more effective and achievable.
  - [[Mission Statement]]
    - The mission statement is a tool that outlines the company's purpose and primary objectives. It is closely related to the vision, as the mission should support the achievement of the vision. The vision provides a long-term direction, while the mission defines the company's day-to-day operations to achieve this direction.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - The PESTEL analysis can be used to evaluate the alignment of the company's vision with the external environment. A vision that is not feasible or relevant given the political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors may need to be revised.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - The Value Proposition Canvas is a tool that helps businesses to understand their customers' needs and to design products and services that meet these needs. The vision of the company can guide the design of the value proposition, ensuring that it aligns with the long-term aspirations and goals of the business model.
