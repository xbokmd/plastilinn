- ## üìñ Description
  The concept of "Assumption List" in business modeling refers to a list of hypotheses or beliefs that the entrepreneurial team holds to be true and relevant to their business. These assumptions are often based on the team's understanding of the market, the customer, the product or service, and the business environment. They serve as the foundation upon which the business model is built and are used to guide decision-making and strategy development.
  
  Here are the key aspects of "Assumption List" in business modeling:
  
  - Market Assumptions: These are assumptions about the market in which the business operates, including the size of the market, the growth rate, the level of competition, and the market trends. For example, a startup might assume that the market for their product is growing at a rate of 10% per year.
  
  - Customer Assumptions: These are assumptions about the customers that the business serves, including their needs, preferences, behaviors, and willingness to pay. For example, a business might assume that their customers value quality over price.
  
  - Product or Service Assumptions: These are assumptions about the product or service that the business offers, including its functionality, value proposition, and competitive advantage. For example, a tech company might assume that their software is more user-friendly than the competition.
  
  - Business Environment Assumptions: These are assumptions about the broader business environment, including the regulatory environment, the economic environment, and the technological environment. For example, a business might assume that there will be no significant regulatory changes in the next few years.
  
  - Financial Assumptions: These are assumptions about the financial aspects of the business, including the cost structure, the revenue model, and the profitability. For example, a business might assume that their cost of goods sold will decrease over time due to economies of scale.
  
  It's important to note that while assumptions are necessary to move forward with a business model, they should be validated or invalidated as soon as possible through market research, customer feedback, and other forms of testing. This helps to reduce risk and uncertainty, and allows the business to adapt its model based on real-world evidence.

- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
    - The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, heavily emphasizes the importance of making assumptions and then testing them. The assumption list is a key component of this methodology. The entrepreneurial team lists their assumptions about their business model and then designs experiments to validate or invalidate these assumptions.
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - While the Business Model Canvas does not explicitly include an assumption list, it is often used in conjunction with one. The entrepreneurial team can list their assumptions about each of the nine components of the canvas and then test these assumptions through customer discovery and validation.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - Similar to the Business Model Canvas, the Value Proposition Canvas can be used in conjunction with an assumption list. The entrepreneurial team can make assumptions about the customer profile and value map and then test these assumptions.
  - [[Customer Development Model]]
    - The Customer Development Model, developed by Steve Blank, is a four-step framework that emphasizes the importance of making and testing assumptions. The assumption list is a key component of the first step, customer discovery.
  - [[Pivot or Persevere]]
    - This tool, also from the Lean Startup methodology, is used after assumptions have been tested. If an assumption is invalidated, the entrepreneurial team must decide whether to pivot (change a fundamental part of the business model) or persevere (keep testing the current model). The assumption list is a critical input to this decision.
  - [[Assumption Mapping]]
    - This tool, developed by David Bland, is specifically designed to help teams identify and test their riskiest assumptions. The assumption list is a key component of this tool. The team lists their assumptions and then maps them based on their level of uncertainty and the impact on the business if the assumption is wrong.
