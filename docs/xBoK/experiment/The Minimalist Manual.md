    - TODO [[Create the minimalist manual]]
      - Develop a manual or guide that describes the functionality of the product that doesn't exist yet. The manual should be concise and easy to understand, providing a clear overview of how the product would work and the problems it would solve.
    - TODO [[Share the manual with potential users]]
      - Distribute the minimalist manual to potential users and invite them to review it. This can be done through various channels such as email, social media, or online forums. Provide clear instructions on how to provide feedback and encourage users to share their thoughts and opinions.
    - TODO [[Gather feedback on the manual]]
      - Collect feedback from the potential users on the functionality and usefulness of the product described in the manual. Ask them to provide specific examples or scenarios where they would use the product and any suggestions or improvements they have.
    - TODO [[Analyze the feedback]]
      - Review the feedback received and identify common themes or patterns. Look for indications of demand for the product, as well as insights on its functionality and usefulness. Pay attention to any suggestions or improvements that can be incorporated into the product design.
    - TODO [[Iterate on the product design]]
      - Based on the feedback received, iterate on the product design to address the identified needs and preferences of potential users. This may involve refining the features, adjusting the user interface, or exploring additional functionalities.
    - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
      - Create updated versions of the minimalist manual and gather feedback from new potential users. Iterate on the product design based on the feedback received to further validate the demand and improve the product.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By creating a minimalist manual and gathering feedback from potential users, we expect to validate the demand for the product and gain insights on its functionality and usefulness. This experiment will help determine if there is a market for the product and guide further iterations of the product design. The expected outcome is to refine the product based on the feedback received and increase the chances of developing a successful and marketable product. Additionally, this experiment will help build awareness and interest in the product among potential users, laying the foundation for future marketing and sales efforts.
