    - TODO [[Develop the MVP]]
      - Identify the core features and functionalities that are necessary to demonstrate the value proposition of the business idea. Develop a prototype or working version of the product that can be used by potential customers.
    - TODO [[Release the MVP]]
      - Make the MVP available to a select group of potential customers. This could be done through a closed beta program, a limited release, or by inviting specific individuals or organizations to try the product.
    - TODO [[Gather feedback]]
      - Encourage the users of the MVP to provide feedback on their experience with the product. This could be done through surveys, interviews, or feedback forms. Actively listen to their feedback and take note of any suggestions, issues, or concerns.
    - TODO [[Analyze the feedback]]
      - Review the feedback received from the users of the MVP. Look for common themes, recurring issues, or positive feedback that can help validate the business idea and guide further iterations.
    - TODO [[Iterate on the MVP]]
      - Based on the feedback received, make necessary improvements or adjustments to the MVP. This could involve fixing bugs, adding new features, or refining the user experience.
    - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
      - Release updated versions of the MVP to gather feedback from a larger group of potential customers. Iterate on the product based on the feedback received to continuously improve and validate the business idea.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By developing and releasing a minimum viable product (MVP), the startup will be able to gather feedback from potential customers and validate the business idea. The feedback received will help identify any issues or areas for improvement in the product, as well as validate the value proposition and market demand. The expected outcome of this experiment is to refine and improve the MVP based on the feedback received, increasing the chances of success for the startup. Additionally, the startup will build relationships with potential customers and gain valuable insights into the market, which can_inform future product development and business strategies.
