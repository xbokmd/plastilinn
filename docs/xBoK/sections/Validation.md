## üìñ Description
  The concept of "Validation" in business modeling refers to the process of testing and verifying the assumptions and hypotheses that underpin a business model. This process is essential in ensuring that the business model is based on accurate and realistic assumptions, and that it is capable of delivering the expected results.
  
  During the validation phase, the assumptions and hypotheses of the business model are put to the test. This could involve conducting market research to validate customer segments and value propositions, running financial simulations to verify revenue streams and cost structures, or carrying out pilot projects to test key activities and partnerships.
  
  For example, a company might validate its business model by launching a minimum viable product (MVP) to a small segment of its target market. The feedback and data gathered from this MVP launch can then be used to validate or invalidate the assumptions about the product's market fit, pricing strategy, and customer acquisition channels. If the assumptions are validated, the company can proceed with confidence. If they are invalidated, the company can pivot and adjust its business model based on the new insights.
  
  The validation phase is not only about confirming the viability of a business model, but also about learning and adapting. It allows businesses to learn from their mistakes, adapt their strategies, and continuously improve their business models.
  
  In essence, the concept of "Validation" in business modeling is about ensuring that a business model is grounded in reality and capable of delivering success. It is a critical aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the ability of a business to survive, thrive, and grow in a competitive market.

## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
    - Developed by Eric Ries, the Lean Startup Methodology emphasizes the importance of validating business models through a build-measure-learn feedback loop. This involves creating a minimum viable product (MVP), measuring how it performs in the market, and learning from the results to iterate or pivot the business model.
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - The Business Model Canvas, while not specifically focused on validation, can be used as a tool for this purpose. By mapping out the key components of a business model, it allows for a comprehensive view that can be used to identify assumptions and hypotheses that need to be tested.
  - [[Customer Development]]
    - This methodology, developed by Steve Blank, is focused on understanding customer needs and validating business model assumptions through customer interaction. It involves four steps: customer discovery, customer validation, customer creation, and company building.
  - [[Experiment Board]]
    - The Experiment Board is a tool developed by Javelin that helps entrepreneurs to validate their business ideas. It guides them through the process of identifying their riskiest assumptions, designing experiments to test these assumptions, and interpreting the results.
  - [[Value Proposition Design]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is focused on designing and testing value propositions. It can be used to validate the value proposition component of a business model by helping to understand the fit between the product or service and customer needs.
  - [[Pivot or Persevere]]
    - This is a decision-making process used in the Lean Startup Methodology. After a cycle of building, measuring, and learning, entrepreneurs need to decide whether to pivot (make a fundamental change to the business model) or persevere (keep testing the current business model). This decision is based on the validation (or lack thereof) of the business model's assumptions.
  - [[Assumption Mapping]]
    - This tool, developed by David J Bland, helps teams to identify and test their riskiest assumptions. It involves creating a map of assumptions, categorizing them based on their risk and uncertainty, and then designing experiments to test the riskiest assumptions.
