    - TODO [[Identify and validate a problem]]
      - TODO [[Conduct market research]]
        - Gather_information about the target market, including demographics, psychographics, and industry trends. Identify potential pain points or unmet needs that customers are facing.
      - TODO [[Validate the problem]]
        - Conduct problem interviews or surveys with potential customers to validate the identified problem. Ask questions to understand if they are experiencing the problem, how it affects them, and if they would be willing to pay to solve it.
    - TODO [[Develop a solution]]
      - TODO [[Brainstorm potential solutions]]
        - Generate ideas for solutions that could address the identified problem. Consider different approaches, technologies, or business models.
      - TODO [[Evaluate and select the best solution]]
        - Assess the feasibility, viability, and desirability of each potential solution. Consider factors such as cost, market demand, competitive landscape, and the startup's capabilities.
      - TODO [[Prototype and test the solution]]
        - Create a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) of the selected solution. Test it with potential customers to gather feedback and validate its effectiveness in solving the identified problem.
      - TODO [[Iterate and refine the solution]]
        - Based on the feedback received from testing, iterate on the solution to improve its functionality, usability, and value proposition. Continuously gather feedback and make adjustments as necessary.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By identifying and validating a problem that customers are willing to pay to solve, and developing a solution that effectively addresses that problem, the startup will create a product or service with a market demand. This will increase the chances of generating revenue and building a successful business. The expected outcome of this experiment is to have a validated problem-solution fit and a refined solution that meets the needs of the target market. Additionally, the startup will gain a deeper understanding of the market dynamics and customer preferences, which can_inform future product development and business strategies.
