## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "profile/perceptions" refers to the understanding and interpretation of a specific group of customers, users, or stakeholders based on their individual profiles. This concept goes beyond the mere collection of demographic or psychographic characteristics, and delves into how these individuals perceive a product, service, or the company itself.
  
  The "profile/perceptions" concept involves gathering and analyzing data on how the target audience perceives the value, quality, and relevance of a product or service. It also includes their perceptions of the company's brand, reputation, and customer service. This information is often collected through surveys, interviews, focus groups, social media monitoring, and other forms of market research.
  
  For example, a company that sells eco-friendly products might have a profile/perceptions model that includes perceptions about the importance of sustainability, the perceived value and quality of eco-friendly products, attitudes towards the company's environmental initiatives, and beliefs about the company's commitment to sustainability.
  
  The concept of "profile/perceptions" is crucial in business modeling as it provides insights into the target audience's mindset, which can guide the development of products, services, and marketing strategies. By understanding their customers' perceptions, companies can address any misconceptions, align their offerings with customer expectations, and build a strong, positive brand image. This can enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, business performance.

## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Customer Relationships" component can be related to the profile/perceptions. This component is about the type of relationship a company establishes with specific customer segments. It can be personal assistance, self-service, automated services, communities, or co-creation. The way these relationships are managed can significantly influence the stakeholders' perceptions of the company.
  - [[Brand Identity Prism]]
    - This tool, developed by Jean-Noel Kapferer, helps businesses build and manage their brand identity. The prism has six facets: physique, personality, culture, relationship, reflection, and self-image. These facets help shape the stakeholders' perceptions of the company.
  - [[Customer Journey Map]]
    - The Customer Journey Map can also be used to understand and manage perceptions. By mapping the customer's experience with the company, businesses can identify points where negative perceptions might be formed and work to improve these areas.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT Analysis can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the company's current profile and perceptions. It can also help identify opportunities to improve positive perceptions and threats that could lead to negative perceptions.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - The PESTEL Analysis can help businesses understand how external factors might influence stakeholders' perceptions. For example, social factors might influence societal perceptions of the company, while legal factors might influence perceptions of the company's compliance with laws and regulations.
  - [[Net Promoter Score (NPS)]]
    - The NPS is a tool that measures customer loyalty and, indirectly, their perception of the business. It is based on one simple question: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?" The answers allow companies to classify customers into Promoters (9-10 score), Passives (7-8 score), and Detractors (0-6 score). The NPS is then calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.
  - [[Social Media Monitoring Tools]]
    - These tools can be used to monitor and manage online perceptions of the company. They can track mentions of the company on social media and analyze the sentiment of these mentions, helping the company understand and manage online perceptions.
