    - TODO [[The Mechanical Turk]]
      - TODO [[Define the tasks to be simulated]]
        - Identify the specific tasks or functions of the product that need to be simulated using the Mechanical Turk technique. This could include user interactions, data processing, or any other aspect of the product's functionality.
      - TODO [[Break down the tasks into smaller units]]
        - Divide the identified tasks into smaller units that can be easily simulated by human workers. This will make it easier to distribute the work among the workers and ensure accurate simulation of the product's functionality.
      - TODO [[Recruit human workers]]
        - Use online platforms or other channels to recruit human workers who can perform the simulated tasks. Provide clear instructions and guidelines to ensure that the tasks are performed accurately and consistently.
      - TODO [[Monitor the simulation process]]
        - Regularly monitor the progress of the simulation process to ensure that the tasks are being performed correctly and according to the defined guidelines. Provide feedback and guidance to the workers as needed.
      - TODO [[Collect feedback from the workers]]
        - Gather feedback from the workers on their experience with the simulation process. Ask for their insights and suggestions on the feasibility and usability of the product based on their simulation experience.
      - TODO [[Analyze the feedback]]
        - Review the feedback collected from the workers and identify any common themes or patterns. Look for insights on the feasibility and usability of the product, as well as any potential improvements or adjustments that can be made.
      - TODO [[Iterate on the product]]
        - Based on the feedback received, make any necessary adjustments or improvements to the product. This could involve refining the design, adding or removing features, or addressing any usability issues identified during the simulation process.
      - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
        - Conduct additional simulations with new human workers to validate the changes made to the product and gather further feedback. This iterative process will help refine the product and ensure its feasibility and usability.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By using the Mechanical Turk technique to simulate the functionality of the product, the startup will gain insights into its feasibility and usability. The feedback collected from the human workers will help identify any potential issues or improvements that need to be addressed. The expected outcome of this experiment is to refine the product based on the feedback received and increase its chances of success in the market. Additionally, the startup will build a stronger understanding of the product's functionality and usability, which can guide future development and iterations.
