- ## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "segment (id)/partners" refers to the identification and categorization of a company's strategic partners based on their specific roles, contributions, and relationships with the company. These partners can be individuals, businesses, or organizations that contribute to the company's value creation, delivery, and capture processes.
  
  The segment (id)/partners is a critical component of business design as it helps businesses to identify and manage their key partnerships, leverage their resources and capabilities, and create synergies. It enables businesses to focus on their core competencies, outsource non-core activities, reduce costs, and increase efficiency.
  
  For example, a tech startup may segment its partners into technology providers, distribution partners, and investors. Technology providers supply the necessary hardware and software, distribution partners help to bring the product to the market, and investors provide the necessary capital. Each partner plays a different role and contributes to the startup's success in different ways.
  
  By understanding the unique roles and contributions of each partner, the startup can manage its partnerships more effectively, align its interests with those of its partners, and create win-win relationships. It can leverage its partners' resources and capabilities to enhance its value proposition, reach more customers, and scale its business.
  
  In essence, the segment (id)/partners is a strategic tool that enables businesses to build and manage their ecosystem, create and deliver value more effectively, and achieve competitive advantage. It is the backbone of collaborative business design and a key driver of business innovation and growth.

- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "Key Partners" are one of the nine building blocks. This component identifies the relationships that a company has with other business entities that help it operate successfully. These can include suppliers, manufacturers, business partners, affiliate businesses, etc. The partnerships can be motivated by various factors such as optimization and economy of scale, risk and uncertainty reduction, acquisition of particular resources and activities.
  - [[Value Chain Analysis]]
    - This tool, developed by Michael Porter, is used to analyze the activities through which a company can create value and competitive advantage. In this context, partners can be seen as part of the "Inbound Logistics" (relationships with suppliers) and "Outbound Logistics" (relationships with distributors).
  - [[Stakeholder Analysis]]
    - Stakeholder Analysis is a technique used to identify and assess the importance of key people, groups of people, or institutions that may significantly influence the success of a project or business. In this context, partners are considered key stakeholders whose interests and influence need to be taken into account.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can identify how these external factors affect their relationships with partners. For example, changes in legislation might affect the way companies work with their partners, or technological advancements might offer new ways of collaborating.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - Although the SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a more general tool, it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of existing partnerships and to identify new opportunities or threats in the realm of business collaborations.
