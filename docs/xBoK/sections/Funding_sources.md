## üìñ Description
  The concept of Funding Sources in business modeling refers to the diverse ways a business model generates revenue or acquires capital to support its operations. This concept is crucial as it directly impacts the financial sustainability and growth potential of a business.
  
  Funding Sources can be broadly categorized into two types: internal and external. Internal funding sources are generated within the business and include revenues from sales, profits retained in the business, and depreciation provisions. These sources are typically recurring and are closely linked to the business's operational performance.
  
  External funding sources, on the other hand, are funds obtained from outside the business. These can include equity capital from shareholders, loans from financial institutions, grants, and subsidies from government bodies, and investments from venture capitalists or angel investors. External funding sources are often used for significant business expansion or development projects.
  
  The choice of funding sources depends on various factors such as the business's stage of development, its financial health, the nature of its operations, and its strategic objectives. For instance, a startup might rely heavily on external funding sources like venture capital and angel investment, while a mature business might primarily use its internal funding sources.
  
  The Funding Sources model is a vital part of business design as it determines how a business finances its operations, invests in growth, and manages financial risks. It also influences other aspects of the business model, such as the value proposition, customer segments, and cost structure.
  
  For example, a software company might generate revenue through subscription fees (an internal funding source) and also raise capital through a series of funding rounds with venture capitalists (an external funding source). These funding sources would support the company's operations, fund its growth initiatives, and shape its business model.
  
  In summary, the Funding Sources model provides a framework for identifying, evaluating, and managing the various ways a business generates revenue or acquires capital. It is a critical component of business design, influencing the business's financial sustainability, growth potential, and overall business strategy.

  SpaceX has raised significant amounts of funding through private equity rounds from venture capital firms and individual investors. Notable investors include Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Google and Fidelity Investments made a large investment in 2015, putting in about $1 billion for a nearly 10% stake in the company.
  
  üíµ#funding Government Contracts
  A substantial portion of SpaceX's funding comes from government contracts, particularly from NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program awarded SpaceX contracts worth several billion dollars over the years for cargo transportation to the International Space Station (ISS). Additionally, SpaceX has secured contracts for national security missions from the U.S. Air Force and Space Force.

  Though SpaceX remains a privately held company and hasn't gone public through an IPO, it has received public funding in the form of government grants and incentives for specific projects and facilities.
  
  üíµ#funding Debt Financing
  SpaceX has also used debt financing to fund its operations. For example, in 2020, SpaceX raised $1.9 billion in one of the largest funding rounds, and later, it was reported that the company raised an additional $850 million through equity and debt.
  
  üíµ#funding Direct Investment from Elon Musk
  Elon Musk, the founder and CEO, has invested a significant amount of his own money into SpaceX, especially in the early days to get the company off the ground. His continued investment demonstrates his commitment to the company's long-term vision.
