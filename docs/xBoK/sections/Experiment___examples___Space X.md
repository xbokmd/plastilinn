      🧪#experiment Reusable Rocket Test

Objective: Validate the Assumption: Cost reduction through reusable rockets by launching and reusing a Falcon 9 rocket multiple times to measure cost savings and operational efficiency.

Tasks and Objectives

⚙️#work Prepare Falcon 9 for Multiple Reuses

Refurbish a previously flown Falcon 9 for 3 consecutive launches. Complete refurbishment within 10 days between launches.

⚙️#work Conduct 3 Falcon 9 Launches

Perform 3 launches within a 60-day period to test rapid reuse capabilities. Complete all 3 launches in 60 days.

⚙️#work Analyze Cost and Time Savings

Calculate the cost per launch and measure savings compared to single-use rockets. Complete cost analysis within 10 days after the last launch.
