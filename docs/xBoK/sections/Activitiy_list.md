## üìñ Description
  The concept of an activity list, in the context of business modeling, refers to the comprehensive set of tasks or processes that a business undertakes to create, deliver, and capture value for its customers. This includes everything from the initial ideation and development of a product or service, to its production, marketing, sales, and after-sales service. 
  
  The purpose of an activity list is to provide a clear and structured overview of the business operations, identify the key value-creating activities, and ensure that they are effectively aligned with the business strategy and customer needs. It serves as a roadmap for the business, guiding its actions and decisions, and helping it to optimize its resources, improve its efficiency, and enhance its value proposition.
  
  For example, consider a restaurant business. Its activity list might include tasks such as sourcing and purchasing ingredients, preparing and cooking meals, serving customers, managing reservations, maintaining the restaurant premises, marketing and promoting the restaurant, and handling customer feedback and complaints. Each of these activities contributes to the overall value that the restaurant provides to its customers, and hence, to its success and profitability.
  
  In essence, an activity list is not just a to-do list for a business. It is a strategic tool that helps a business to understand and manage its operations, focus on its core competencies, and create a unique and compelling value proposition for its customers. It is a critical aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the business's ability to meet its objectives and satisfy its customers.

## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)]]
    - BPMN is a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a business process model. It provides businesses with a standard method of illustrating the flow of activities (activity list) in a process, making it easier to understand and manage.
  - [[Value Stream Mapping]]
    - This lean-management method is used for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer. It helps to visualize and understand the flow of materials and information as a product or service moves along the value stream.
  - [[Gantt Chart]]
    - A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity.
  - [[Critical Path Method (CPM)]]
    - CPM is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities. It provides a visual representation of project activities, helps to estimate the duration of a project, and shows which tasks are critical to keep the project on schedule.
  - [[Kanban]]
    - Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. It visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.
  - [[Six Sigma]]
    - Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It seeks to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes.
  - [[Lean Manufacturing]]
    - Lean Manufacturing is a systematic method for waste minimization within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity. It considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination.
