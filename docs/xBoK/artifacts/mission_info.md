- ## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "mission" refers to the fundamental purpose or reason for the existence of a business. It is the driving force behind all business decisions and actions, providing a clear direction and focus for the organization. The mission is typically expressed in a mission statement, which is a brief, concise declaration of the business's core purpose.
  
  The mission is a critical component of a business model as it defines the business's overall goals and guides its strategies and operations. It communicates what the business does, who it serves, and how it provides value to its customers or clients. The mission also serves as a motivational tool, inspiring employees and stakeholders to work towards the common goal.
  
  For example, the mission of a non-profit organization might be "to provide educational opportunities for underprivileged children." This mission guides all of the organization's activities, from fundraising to program development. It also communicates to stakeholders - including donors, volunteers, and the community - what the organization is striving to achieve.
  
  In essence, the concept of "mission" in business modeling is about defining and articulating the fundamental purpose of a business. It is a crucial element in business design, providing direction, focus, and motivation, and shaping the business's strategies and operations.

- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "mission" is not explicitly represented as a separate component. However, it is implicitly embedded in the "value proposition" and "customer segments" components. The value proposition reflects what the business stands for and what it offers to its customers, while the customer segments reflect who the business serves, both of which should align with the mission.
  - [[Vision and Mission Statements]]
    - These are traditional tools used by businesses to articulate their purpose and goals. The mission statement, in particular, is a concise explanation of the business's reason for existence. It should reflect the values of the business and provide a guiding direction for all its activities.
  - [[Balanced Scorecard]]
    - This strategic planning and management system is used to align business activities with the vision and mission of the organization. It provides a framework for translating a business's mission and vision into a set of performance measures distributed among four perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal Business Processes, and Learning and Growth.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - While the SWOT analysis is a more general tool, it can be used to evaluate the alignment of a business's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats with its mission. For example, a business can identify strengths that enable it to fulfill its mission, or threats that could hinder it from achieving its mission.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - The PESTEL analysis can be used to understand the external macro-environmental factors that affect a business's ability to achieve its mission. For example, social factors could influence public perception of a business's mission, or legal factors could impose restrictions on how a business can pursue its mission.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, can be used to ensure that a business's products or services are aligned with its mission. The "value proposition" component should reflect the business's mission, and the "customer jobs, pains, and gains" components should reflect how the business fulfills its mission through its offerings.
