  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Value Proposition" component is closely related to the "Solution (ID)/Brochure" concept. The value proposition is the unique combination of products and services that meet the customer's needs. It's the reason why customers turn to one company over another. The brochure, in this case, would be a tool to communicate this value proposition effectively to the customer.
  - [[Marketing Mix]]
    - The "Product" component of the Marketing Mix can be related to the "Solution (ID)/Brochure". The product is what a business sells to its customers and the brochure is a tool to communicate the features, benefits, and advantages of this product. The brochure can be seen as part of the "Promotion" strategy, as it is a way to advertise and sell the product.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The "Solution (ID)/Brochure" can be evaluated using a SWOT analysis. The strengths and weaknesses of the solution can be identified, as well as the opportunities and threats in the market. The brochure can be used to highlight the strengths and opportunities, and to address the weaknesses and threats.
  - [[Customer Journey Map]]
    - The "Solution (ID)/Brochure" can be incorporated into the Customer Journey Map. The brochure can be used at different stages of the customer journey to provide information, answer questions, and persuade the customer to purchase the solution.

    - The "Solution (ID)/Brochure" can be influenced by external factors analyzed in the PESTEL framework. For example, technological factors can affect the format and distribution of the brochure, and social factors can influence the design and content of the brochure. The solution itself can be affected by all six factors: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal.
