- ## üìñ Description
  The concept of "segment (id)/profiles" in business modeling refers to the identification and characterization of distinct groups within a company's market, based on shared characteristics or behaviors. These profiles are created after the segmentation process and provide a more detailed understanding of each segment.
  
  Segment profiles can include a wide range of information, such as demographic details, buying behaviors, needs, preferences, lifestyle characteristics, and more. The goal is to create a comprehensive picture of each segment, which can then be used to tailor products, services, and marketing efforts to meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.
  
  For instance, a car manufacturer might identify a segment of customers who are environmentally conscious and prefer electric vehicles. The profile for this segment might include details such as average age, income level, common values (such as sustainability), and typical buying behaviors (such as a willingness to pay a premium for eco-friendly products). This profile would then inform the development of products and marketing strategies targeted specifically at this group.
  
  In essence, the concept of "segment (id)/profiles" in business modeling is about creating detailed portraits of each customer group, based on shared characteristics and behaviors. This allows a company to better understand its customers and tailor its offerings and marketing efforts accordingly, leading to improved customer satisfaction and business performance. It is a key component of business design, informing the development of a company's products, services, and marketing strategies.

- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "customer segments" are one of the nine key components. This refers to the different groups of people or organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve. It's important to identify and understand these segments to tailor the value proposition, channels, and customer relationships to their specific needs.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a supplement to the Business Model Canvas. It helps businesses to understand their customer profiles in depth, including their jobs, pains, and gains. This understanding can then be used to design products and services that meet their needs.
  - [[Empathy Map]]
    - An Empathy Map is a tool that helps businesses to gain a deeper insight into their customers. It involves segmenting customers into different profiles and then considering what each profile is seeing, hearing, thinking, feeling, saying, and doing in relation to the product or service.
  - [[Persona Development]]
    - This is a method used in design thinking and user-centered design. It involves creating fictional characters, or "personas", that represent different user types within a targeted demographic, attitude, or behavior set that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way.
  - [[Market Segmentation]]
    - This is a process of dividing a market of potential customers into groups, or segments, based on different characteristics. The segments created are composed of consumers who will respond similarly to marketing strategies and who share traits such as similar interests, needs, or locations.
  - [[Jobs to be Done]]
    - This is a theory of consumer action. It proposes that consumers buy products and services to get specific jobs done. By understanding what job a customer needs done, a business can better tailor its offerings. This often involves creating profiles of customers based on the jobs they need done.
