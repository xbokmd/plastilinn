- ## üìñ Description
  The concept of "people" in business modeling refers to the founders or individuals who establish and initiate a business model. These individuals often take on leadership roles in the development and growth of the business. They are the visionaries who conceive the business idea, identify the market opportunity, and design the business model to exploit this opportunity.
  
  The role of the founders is critical in a business model because they are the ones who set the direction and strategy of the business. They make key decisions about the business's value proposition, target market, revenue streams, cost structure, and other elements of the business model. They also often play a significant role in securing the resources needed to launch and grow the business, such as capital, talent, and partnerships.
  
  For example, in a tech startup, the founders might be the ones who come up with an innovative software solution, identify the potential customers for this solution, and design a business model to deliver this solution to the market. They might also be the ones who raise venture capital, recruit a talented team, and forge strategic partnerships to support the startup's growth.
  
  In addition to their strategic role, the founders also often play a key operational role in the business, especially in the early stages. They might be involved in product development, sales, marketing, customer service, and other operational activities. This hands-on involvement allows them to understand the business's operations intimately, make informed decisions, and drive the business's growth and success.
  
  In essence, the concept of "people" in business modeling is about recognizing the pivotal role of the founders in establishing, developing, and growing the business. It's a crucial aspect of business design, as the founders' vision, decisions, and actions can significantly impact the business's trajectory and performance.
