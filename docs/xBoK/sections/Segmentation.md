## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "profile/segmentation" refers to the process of dividing a company's market into distinct groups of buyers who might require separate products or marketing mixes. These groups, or segments, are defined by shared characteristics such as demographics, behaviors, needs, or preferences. 
  
  The profile/segmentation is a fundamental component of business design as it allows companies to target their products or services more effectively, understand their customers better, and allocate their resources more efficiently. It enables businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, meet the specific needs of their customers, and achieve a competitive advantage.
  
  For instance, a clothing retailer may segment its market into different profiles such as teenagers, young adults, and seniors. Each segment has different fashion tastes, shopping behaviors, and purchasing power. Teenagers might prefer trendy and affordable clothes, young adults might look for professional and high-quality outfits, and seniors might value comfort and durability.
  
  By understanding the unique characteristics and needs of each segment, the retailer can tailor its products, pricing, and marketing strategies to meet the specific needs of each segment. It can create a personalized shopping experience, build stronger relationships with its customers, and increase customer loyalty and satisfaction.
  
  In essence, the profile/segmentation is a strategic tool that enables businesses to understand and serve their market more effectively, create and deliver value more efficiently, and achieve sustainable growth. It is the foundation of customer-centric business design and a key driver of business success.

## üóÑÔ∏è Topics
  


## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "customer segments" is one of the nine key components. This refers to the different groups of people or organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve. Companies need to identify and understand their customer segments in order to effectively meet their distinct needs and solve their problems.
  - [[Market Segmentation]]
    - This is a strategic tool used to divide a broad target market into subsets of consumers with similar needs and characteristics. The four main types of market segmentation are demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral. This tool helps businesses to target these segments effectively and allocate marketing resources appropriately.
  - [[Persona Development]]
    - This tool involves creating fictional characters that represent your different customer segments. Each persona is based on research and includes specific details about the character‚Äôs demographics, behaviors, needs, motivations, and challenges. This helps businesses to understand and empathize with their customers on a deeper level.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, helps businesses to understand their customer segments better by focusing on customer jobs, pains, and gains. By understanding what tasks customers are trying to accomplish, what pains they are trying to avoid, and what gains they are hoping to achieve, businesses can create products and services that better meet the needs of each segment.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - Although the SWOT analysis is a more general tool, it can be used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a company's segmentation strategy. It can also help to identify opportunities for reaching new segments or threats from competitors targeting the same segments.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can identify how these external factors affect their segmentation strategy. For example, social trends can lead to the emergence of new customer segments.
