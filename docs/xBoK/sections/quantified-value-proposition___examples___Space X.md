        - It is widely recognized that Space X's reusable rocket technology has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into space.
         By recovering and reusing rocket boosters, Space X aims to decrease launch costs by eliminating the need to build new rockets for each mission.
         This approach has already demonstrated cost savings compared to traditional expendable rockets.
         Let's consider a scenario where a traditional expendable rocket launch costs $100 million for a specific payload.
         Now, imagine that Space X's reusable rocket technology allows for a cost reduction of 30% per launch due to the reuse of the rocket's first stage.
         In this example, if Space X were to launch the same payload using their reusable rocket system, the cost savings would amount to $30 million per launch.
         This significant reduction in launch costs can have a substantial impact on the overall budget of space agencies, allowing for more frequent launches, additional missions, or the allocation of resources to other critical areas.
