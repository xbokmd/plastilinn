    #experiment Reusable Rocket Test
     Assumption: Cost reduction through reusable rockets will significantly lower launch costs.
     Experiment: Conduct rapid, repeated launches with reusable rockets (e.g., Falcon 9) in a short timeframe to assess wear, repair costs, and operational efficiency compared to traditional rockets.
     Metric: Cost per launch and turnaround time for the next flight.

#experiment Market Demand Validation for Commercial Space Services
     Assumption: There is Demand for commercial space services that is growing and sustained.
     Experiment: Launch a pre-sale campaign or survey potential clients (e.g., satellite companies) to measure interest in launch services and track how many requests for quotes are received.
     Metric: Number of quote requests and early reservations.

#experiment Crewed Mission Safety Simulation
     Risk: Safety and Crewed Missions require robust systems for frequent human spaceflights.
     Experiment: Conduct in-flight abort and atmospheric re-entry simulations with the Crew Dragon capsule, testing the safety of emergency systems in different critical scenarios.
     Metric: Success rate of safe aborts and performance of emergency systems.
