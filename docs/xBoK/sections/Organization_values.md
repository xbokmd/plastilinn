## 📖 Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "organization values" refers to the core principles or standards that guide a company's actions and decisions. These values are deeply ingrained in the company's culture and serve as a compass for its behavior, shaping its interactions with stakeholders, its approach to business, and its overall identity.
  
  Organization values are a critical component of a business model because they define what the company stands for and what it believes in. They influence every aspect of the business, from its mission and vision to its strategies and operations. They also play a key role in attracting and retaining employees, customers, and partners who share the same values.
  
  For example, a company might have organization values centered around innovation, customer satisfaction, and social responsibility. These values would guide the company's actions and decisions, leading it to invest in research and development, prioritize customer needs, and engage in sustainable practices.
  
  In essence, the concept of "organization values" in business modeling is about defining and embodying the principles that drive a company's actions and decisions. It is a fundamental element in business design, shaping the company's culture, strategy, and brand identity. It influences how the company is perceived by its stakeholders and how it contributes to society at large.
