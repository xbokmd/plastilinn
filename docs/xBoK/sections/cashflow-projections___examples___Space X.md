### Explanation:
     **Cash Inflows** represent the revenue streams from SpaceX's various operations, increasing over time as the company expands its service offerings and scales its operations.
     **Cash Outflows** include all major categories of expenses SpaceX would incur, reflecting the investments in R&D, manufacturing, operations, and other operational costs.
     **Net Cash Flow** for each phase is calculated by subtracting Total Outflows from Total Inflows, indicating the operational cash generated (or used) during each phase.
     **Cumulative Cash Flow** tracks the running total of Net Cash Flow over the phases, showing how operational cash position changes over time.
