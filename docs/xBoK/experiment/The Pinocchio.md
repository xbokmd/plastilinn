  - ### #[[work]]
    - TODO [[Build the physical mock-up]]
      - Create a non-working model of the product using any material that effectively represents the idea. This could be a prototype made from cardboard, clay, or any other suitable material.
    - TODO [[Identify potential customers for feedback]]
      - Define the target market segment that the product is intended for. This could be based on demographics, psychographics, or specific industry verticals.
    - TODO [[Conduct feedback sessions]]
      - Schedule feedback sessions with potential customers from the target market segment. Present the physical mock-up of the product and ask for their feedback on the design, functionality, and usability.
    - TODO [[Ask specific questions]]
      - During the feedback sessions, ask specific questions to gather insights on the feasibility and effectiveness of the product design. Encourage participants to provide detailed feedback and suggestions for improvement.
    - TODO [[Analyze the feedback]]
      - Review the feedback received from the potential customers and identify common themes or patterns. Look for suggestions or concerns that can help refine the product design.
    - TODO [[Iterate on the product design]]
      - Based on the feedback received, make necessary adjustments to the product design to address the identified issues or suggestions. This may involve refining the aesthetics, improving the functionality, or enhancing the user experience.
    - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
      - Build an updated version of the physical mock-up and conduct additional feedback sessions with new potential customers. Iterate on the product design based on the feedback received to ensure continuous improvement.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By building a physical mock-up of the product and gathering feedback from potential customers, we expect to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the design. The feedback received will help identify any design flaws or usability issues that need to be addressed. This iterative process will lead to an improved product design that meets the needs and preferences of the target market segment. Ultimately, this experiment will increase the chances of developing a successful and marketable product.
