  - ### #[[goal]]
    - #goal [[Gauge initial reactions to a product]]
    - #goal [[Test a product with minimal time and resource investment]]
  - ### Hypothesis
    - By testing a product for a very short period, we can quickly gather initial reactions and feedback from potential customers. This will help us assess the viability and potential of the product without investing significant time or resources.

    - TODO [[The One Night Stand]]
      - TODO [[Define the product to be tested]]
        - Clearly define the product or feature that will be tested using the one night stand technique. This could be a minimum viable product (MVP) or a specific feature of an existing product.
      - TODO [[Identify potential customers]]
        - Identify a group of potential customers who would be interested in the product or feature being tested. This could be based on demographics, psychographics, or other relevant factors.
      - TODO [[Promote the product]]
        - Promote the product or feature to the identified group of potential customers. This can be done through various channels such as social media, online forums, or targeted advertising.
      - TODO [[Collect feedback]]
        - Encourage the potential customers to try out the product or feature and provide feedback. This can be done through surveys, interviews, or other feedback collection methods. Collect both quantitative and qualitative feedback to gain a comprehensive understanding of the initial reactions.
      - TODO [[Analyze the feedback]]
        - Review the collected feedback and identify common themes, patterns, and insights. Look for areas of improvement or potential opportunities based on the feedback received.
      - TODO [[Iterate on the product]]
        - Based on the feedback received, make necessary iterations or improvements to the product or feature. This could involve refining the user experience, adding new features, or addressing any identified pain points.
      - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
        - Conduct additional one night stand tests with new potential customers to gather more feedback and validate the changes made to the product. This iterative process will help refine the product and increase its chances of success in the market.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By testing a product for a very short period using the one night stand technique, we expect to gather initial reactions and feedback from potential customers. This will help us assess the viability and potential of the product without investing significant time or resources. The expected outcome of this experiment is to identify areas of improvement, address any pain points, and refine the product based on the feedback received. Ultimately, this will increase the chances of developing a successful and marketable product.
