    ðŸ§ª#experiment Reusable Rocket Test

Assumption: Cost reduction through reusable rockets will significantly lower launch costs.

Experiment: Conduct rapid, repeated launches with reusable rockets (e.g., Falcon 9) in a short timeframe to assess wear, repair costs, and operational efficiency compared to traditional rockets.

Metric: Cost per launch and turnaround time for the next flight.

ðŸ§ª#experiment Market Demand Validation for Commercial Space Services

Assumption: There is Demand for commercial space services that is growing and sustained.

Experiment: Launch a pre-sale campaign or survey potential clients (e.g., satellite companies) to measure interest in launch services and track how many requests for quotes are received.

Metric: Number of quote requests and early reservations.

ðŸ§ª#experiment Crewed Mission Safety Simulation

Risk: Safety and Crewed Missions require robust systems for frequent human spaceflights.

Experiment: Conduct in-flight abort and atmospheric re-entry simulations with the Crew Dragon capsule, testing the safety of emergency systems in different critical scenarios.

Metric: Success rate of safe aborts and performance of emergency systems.
