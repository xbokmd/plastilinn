  The concept of "Person/Inputs" in business modeling refers to the specific individuals or resources that contribute to the value creation process within a business model. These inputs are not just random elements, but carefully identified individuals or resources that have a direct impact on the business operations and outcomes.
  
  In a business model, "Person/Inputs" are fundamental components as they are the key contributors to the execution of the business activities. They are responsible for carrying out specific tasks or providing necessary resources, and their performance or quality directly impacts the success of the business.
  
  The identification of "Person/Inputs" can vary depending on the nature of the business and the tasks at hand. It can include different roles such as employees, suppliers, partners, or even customers. Each identified person or input has a specific role and responsibilities, and they all need to work together in a coordinated manner to achieve the business goals.
  
  For example, in a manufacturing business, the "Person/Inputs" might include roles such as production manager, machine operators, raw material suppliers, and quality control inspectors. Each of these roles is crucial for the business to produce and deliver high-quality products to the customers.
  
  The concept of "Person/Inputs" in business modeling is not just about identifying the people or resources involved in the business operations. It's about understanding their roles, responsibilities, and contributions to the value creation process. It's about creating a system where these inputs can effectively collaborate to achieve the business goals.
  
  In conclusion, the "Person/Inputs" concept in business modeling is a critical element that contributes to the effective execution of the business activities and the achievement of the business goals. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and understanding the key contributors to the value creation process in a business model.
