Business modeling powered by Artificial Intelligence
----------------------------------------------------

plastilinn’s innCoPilot is a custom **GPT chatbot** that helps you generate creative product or service ideas, exploring various angles and perspectives. It offers **guidance on completing your business model**, including aspects such as market analysis, marketing strategies, financial planning, organizational structure, understanding market trends, analyzing customer demographics, and evaluating competitor behavior. It can **help you make informed choices** by evaluating different strategic options, and provides continuous support and instant feedback, crucial for iterative business development and improvement.

Your business model info in one place
-------------------------------------

plastilinn **centralizes your business model information** in a single place, avoiding data dispersion across multiple files on your hard drive (a PowerPoint with your Business Model Canvas, a PDF with your Value Proposition Canvas, an Excel file with your competitive analysis). This makes it easy to **update, maintain, and visualize** the components of the business model from different angles. Use the tools you know, such as the Business Model Canvas, to input information and adapt it to your business needs.

Methodology and tools
---------------------

plastilinn is **based on popular innovation methodologies and tools**, such as Lean Startup, Customer Development, and Design Thinking, integrating them and avoiding overlaps. Additionally, **it provides the information you need** at each moment to follow the process of creating your business model. Our methodology clearly defines who should do what, how they should do it, and when. It facilitates the **complete cycle of design, analysis, and validation** of your business model systematically and dynamically.

Task prioritization and experimentation
---------------------------------------

plastilinn offers **templates** that fit your project. If your project, for example, is an e-commerce site, you don’t have to start from a blank canvas. Instead, you can use a template and customize it.

It also provides **reference content**. For example, when you need to identify the channels that you will use to reach your customers, it provides an **extensive list** for you to incorporate into your business model without starting from scratch.

Our platform facilitates the management of tasks related to your business model, **helping you prioritize work and experiments** efficiently. Focus on the tasks that most contribute to maximizing the chances of success for your business.

Based on LogSeq and open source
-------------------------------

[LogSeq](https://logseq.com) is a note-taking and knowledge management tool that provides a **structured and interconnected** approach to organizing information and creating a network of linked notes. LogSeq allows users to create and link together blocks of text, create bi-directional links between related ideas, and navigate their notes in a non-linear manner. It uses **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language that allows users to format their notes using plain text syntax. LogSeq is designed to be a local-first application, which means that users have full control over their data, and their notes are **stored locally on their devices**. As an open-source project, LogSeq is actively developed and maintained by a community of contributors.
