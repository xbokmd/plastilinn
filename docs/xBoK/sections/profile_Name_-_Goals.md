- ## üìñ Description
  The concept of "profile/goals" in business modeling refers to the identification and characterization of individual or group profiles within a company's market, and aligning them with specific goals. These profiles are created based on a variety of factors, such as demographic details, buying behaviors, needs, preferences, lifestyle characteristics, and more. The associated goals are then set in accordance with these profiles to ensure that the company's offerings meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.
  
  The goals associated with each profile can be diverse, ranging from increasing customer satisfaction, boosting sales, improving product quality, to enhancing brand awareness. The aim is to create a comprehensive understanding of each profile, which can then be used to tailor products, services, and marketing efforts to achieve the set goals.
  
  For instance, a clothing retailer might identify a profile of customers who are fashion-forward and prefer high-end brands. The goals for this profile might include increasing brand loyalty, boosting sales of premium products, and enhancing the company's reputation as a luxury retailer. The retailer would then develop products and marketing strategies specifically targeted at this group to achieve these goals.
  
  In essence, the concept of "profile/goals" in business modeling is about creating detailed portraits of each customer group or individual, based on shared characteristics and behaviors, and aligning them with specific business goals. This allows a company to better understand its customers and tailor its offerings and marketing efforts accordingly, leading to improved customer satisfaction and business performance. It is a key component of business design, informing the development of a company's products, services, and marketing strategies.

The "Customer Profile" section of the canvas includes three components: customer jobs (what customers are trying to get done in their lives), pains (the problems and challenges related to these jobs), and gains (the benefits customers hope to achieve).
  - [[SMART Goals]]
    - SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) Goals are a tool for setting and achieving goals. This tool can be used to define the goals of stakeholders in a clear and actionable way, which can then inform the design of the business model.
  - [[Stakeholder Analysis]]
    - This tool is used to identify and understand the interests, goals, and power of a business's stakeholders. This understanding can then be used to shape the business model and strategy.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can be used to understand the problems, needs, and desires of stakeholders. For example, weaknesses might represent problems that stakeholders are facing, while opportunities might represent unmet needs or desires.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
