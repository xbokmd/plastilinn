- ## 📖 Description
  The concept of "solution/components" in business modeling refers to the various technologies and components that make up the final product or service that a company offers to its customers. These components are the building blocks that work together to solve a customer's problem or meet their needs.
  
  The "solution" part of the concept refers to the unique identifier of the final product or service. This could be a specific model of a product, a version of a software, or a type of service. The solution is what the customer interacts with and what ultimately delivers the value that the customer is seeking.
  
  The "components" part of the concept refers to the different technologies and parts that make up the solution. For example, in the case of a software product, the components could include the programming language used, the cloud platform on which it's hosted, the database system used, and so on. In the case of a physical product, the components could be the different parts that make up the product.
  
  Each component plays a crucial role in the functionality and performance of the solution. Therefore, it's important to carefully select and manage these components to ensure that they work together effectively to deliver a high-quality solution.
  
  In essence, the concept of "solution/components" in business modeling is about understanding and managing the building blocks of a product or service. It provides a framework for designing and optimizing the solution, and helps the company to make informed decisions about the technologies and components to use. This is a key aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the quality of the product or service and the value it delivers to customers.
