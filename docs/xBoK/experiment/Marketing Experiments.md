    - #goal [[Build a business based on the principles of iterative product development, validated learning, and continuous improvement]]
  - ### Description
    - Lean Startup is a methodology developed by Eric Ries that aims to build businesses in a more efficient and effective way. It is based on the principles of iterative product development, validated learning, and continuous improvement. The Lean Startup approach emphasizes the importance of testing assumptions, gathering feedback from customers, and making data-driven decisions. By following this methodology, startups can reduce the risk of failure and increase their chances of success.
  - ### Key principles
    - #### Iterative product development
      - Instead of spending a long time developing a product or service in isolation, the Lean Startup approach encourages startups to build a minimum viable product (MVP) and quickly release it to the market. This allows for early feedback and iteration based on real-world usage.
    - #### Validated learning
      - The Lean Startup methodology emphasizes the importance of learning from customer feedback and data. Startups should focus on validating their assumptions and hypotheses through experiments and measurements. This helps to reduce uncertainty and make_informed decisions.
    - #### Continuous improvement
      - The Lean Startup approach encourages startups to continuously improve their products, services, and business models based on feedback and data. This involves regularly testing and iterating on ideas, and being open to pivoting or changing direction if necessary.
  - ### Key activities
    - #### Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop
      - The core of the Lean Startup methodology is the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Startups should build a minimum viable product, measure its performance and customer feedback, and learn from the results. This feedback loop helps to validate assumptions, identify improvements, and guide the next iteration.
    - #### Validated learning through experiments
      - Startups should conduct experiments to test their assumptions and gather data. These experiments can take various forms, such as problem interviews, solution interviews, A___B testing, or pilot programs. The goal is to validate or invalidate hypotheses and make data-driven decisions.
    - #### Pivot or persevere
      - Based on the insights gained from experiments and validated learning, startups should be willing to pivot or persevere. If the data suggests that the current approach is not working, startups should be open to changing direction or exploring new opportunities. Conversely, if the data supports the current approach, startups should persevere and double down on their efforts.
  - ### Benefits
    - The Lean Startup methodology offers several benefits for startups, including:
      -   - Reducing the risk of failure by validating assumptions and hypotheses early on
      -   - Saving time and resources by focusing on building a minimum viable product and iterating based on feedback
      -   - Increasing the chances of success by making data-driven decisions and continuously improving the product or service
      -   - Building a strong understanding of the target market and customer needs through validated learning
      -   - Creating a culture of experimentation and innovation within the startup
  - ### Challenges
    - Implementing the Lean Startup methodology can also present challenges for startups, including:
      -   - Balancing the need for speed and iteration with the need for quality and reliability
      -   - Overcoming resistance to change and embracing a culture of experimentation
      -   - Managing limited resources and prioritizing experiments and improvements
      -   - Dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in the early stages of the startup
      -   - Maintaining focus and avoiding the temptation to chase multiple ideas or opportunities simultaneously
