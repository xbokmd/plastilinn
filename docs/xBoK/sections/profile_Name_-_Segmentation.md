- ## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "profile/segmentation" refers to the process of dividing a company's market into distinct groups of buyers who might require separate products or marketing mixes. These groups, or segments, are defined by shared characteristics such as demographics, behaviors, needs, or preferences. 
  
  The profile/segmentation is a fundamental component of business design as it allows companies to target their products or services more effectively, understand their customers better, and allocate their resources more efficiently. It enables businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, meet the specific needs of their customers, and achieve a competitive advantage.
  
  For instance, a clothing retailer may segment its market into different profiles such as teenagers, young adults, and seniors. Each segment has different fashion tastes, shopping behaviors, and purchasing power. Teenagers might prefer trendy and affordable clothes, young adults might look for professional and high-quality outfits, and seniors might value comfort and durability.
  
  By understanding the unique characteristics and needs of each segment, the retailer can tailor its products, pricing, and marketing strategies to meet the specific needs of each segment. It can create a personalized shopping experience, build stronger relationships with its customers, and increase customer loyalty and satisfaction.
  
  In essence, the profile/segmentation is a strategic tool that enables businesses to understand and serve their market more effectively, create and deliver value more efficiently, and achieve sustainable growth. It is the foundation of customer-centric business design and a key driver of business success.
