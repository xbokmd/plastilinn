    SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has established itself as a trailblazer in the aerospace industry, significantly reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars as its ultimate goal. A standout achievement is the development and successful reuse of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, making space travel more sustainable and cost-effective. The company has launched over 100 missions, including commercial satellite deployments, International Space Station (ISS) resupply missions under NASA contracts, and the historic manned Crew Dragon missions.
