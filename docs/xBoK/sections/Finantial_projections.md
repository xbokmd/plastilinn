- ## üìñ Description
  The concept of "Financial Projections" in business modeling refers to the process of forecasting a company's future financial performance based on historical data, current economic conditions, and future expectations. These projections are used to estimate revenues, expenses, and profitability over a specific period, typically for the next fiscal year, but can also extend to five years or more.
  
  Financial projections are an essential part of a business plan, as they provide a quantitative measure of the expectations for the business. They are used by both internal management and external stakeholders, such as investors and lenders, to understand the potential financial outcomes of a business model.
  
  The process of creating financial projections involves several steps. First, the company must analyze its historical financial data to understand its past performance. This includes revenues, costs, and profitability, as well as any trends or patterns in the data.
  
  Next, the company must make assumptions about the future. This can include assumptions about market conditions, customer behavior, pricing, costs, and other factors that could impact financial performance. These assumptions should be based on thorough research and analysis, and they should be realistic and achievable.
  
  Finally, the company uses these assumptions to create a set of financial projections. These projections typically include an income statement, a balance sheet, and a cash flow statement. They provide a detailed picture of the company's expected financial performance, including revenues, expenses, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows.
  
  In conclusion, financial projections are a critical tool in business design and modeling. They provide a forward-looking view of a company's financial performance, based on a combination of historical data and future assumptions. They can help companies plan for the future, make strategic decisions, and attract investment.

  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "cost structure" and "revenue streams" are two of the nine key components. These elements are directly related to financial projections as they outline the major costs incurred while operating under a particular business model and the ways in which the business makes money from each customer segment. By analyzing these components, businesses can estimate future financial performance.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - SWOT Analysis can be used to identify internal and external factors that may affect the financial projections of a business. Strengths and weaknesses can provide insight into internal factors such as operational efficiency and cost management, while opportunities and threats can highlight external factors such as market trends and competition.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - PESTEL Analysis can help businesses understand the macro-environmental factors that can impact their financial projections. Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors can all have significant effects on a business's revenue and costs.
  - [[Financial Forecasting]]
    - Financial forecasting is a specific tool used to estimate or predict a business's future financial performance. This typically involves the use of historical data and assumptions about future trends to project income, expenses, and cash flow.
  - [[Break-Even Analysis]]
    - Break-even analysis is a tool used to determine the point at which a business's revenues will cover its costs. This can be crucial for financial projections as it provides a clear target for a business to aim for in order to become profitable.
  - [[Scenario Planning]]
    - Scenario planning is a strategic planning tool that allows businesses to make flexible long-term plans. It involves creating a few consistent and plausible scenarios of the future, each of which has different implications for a business's financial projections. This can help businesses prepare for a range of possible outcomes.
  - [[Sensitivity Analysis]]
    - Sensitivity analysis is a tool used to understand how different values of an independent variable impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions. This technique is used within specific boundaries that depend on one or more input variables, such as the effect of changes in interest rates or inflation on a business's financial projections.
