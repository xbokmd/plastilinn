    Revenue from meat sales: The total revenue generated from selling the revived extinct animal meat to customers over their relationship with the company.
Revenue from repeat purchases: The estimated revenue generated from customers who continue to purchase the luxury meat over time.
Revenue from referrals: The potential revenue generated from customers who refer others to purchase the luxury meat.
Revenue from additional services: If the company offers additional services, such as educational tours or genetic testing, the revenue generated from these services can also be included in the lifetime value calculation.
To calculate the lifetime value, the revenue generated from the customer would be discounted to its present value using an appropriate discount rate, considering the time value of money and the uncertainty of future cash flows. The resulting net present value would represent the lifetime value of the customer to the company.
