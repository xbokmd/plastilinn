  A marketing plan, in the context of business design, is a strategic document that outlines the specific strategies and tactics a business will use to promote and sell its products or services. It is a comprehensive plan that details the marketing objectives of a business, the target market, and how the business intends to reach that market to achieve its objectives.
  
  The marketing plan begins with a market analysis, which involves researching and understanding the needs, preferences, and behaviors of the target market. This analysis provides valuable insights that inform the development of the marketing strategies and tactics.
