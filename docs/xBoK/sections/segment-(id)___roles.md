- ## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, "segment (id)/roles" refers to the categorization of different groups within a business model based on their specific roles or functions. This concept is crucial in understanding the dynamics of a business and how different segments interact with each other and contribute to the overall functioning of the business.
  
  - Segment (id): This refers to the different divisions or departments within a business. Each segment has its own unique identity and role within the organization. For example, in a manufacturing company, segments could include production, marketing, sales, and customer service. Each of these segments has a specific role and contributes to the overall success of the business in different ways.
  
  - Roles: Within each segment, individuals or groups are assigned specific roles based on their skills, expertise, and the needs of the business. These roles define the responsibilities and tasks that each individual or group is expected to perform. For example, in the marketing segment, roles could include market research, advertising, public relations, and digital marketing.
  
  The concept of segment (id)/roles is essential in business design as it helps in organizing the business structure, defining responsibilities, and ensuring that all necessary functions are covered. It also aids in identifying potential gaps or overlaps in roles, which can then be addressed to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
  
  For example, a business may identify that the role of digital marketing is not being adequately covered within the marketing segment. This could lead to the creation of a new role or the expansion of an existing role to ensure that this function is effectively managed.
  
  In essence, the concept of segment (id)/roles is a fundamental aspect of business modeling, providing a clear structure and direction for the organization and contributing to its overall success and sustainability.

- ## üóÑÔ∏è Topics
  
- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, "Key Partnerships" and "Customer Segments" are two of the nine key components. The roles involved in the purchasing decision can be identified and analyzed within these components. For instance, the "Key Partnerships" can include those who influence the purchasing decision, while the "Customer Segments" can help identify the roles of different customers in the purchasing process.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, which is a supplement to the Business Model Canvas, allows businesses to dive deeper into the customer's needs and wants. The "Customer Profile" section can help identify the roles of different individuals involved in the purchasing decision, and how the product or service can meet their specific needs.
  - [[Stakeholder Analysis]]
    - This tool is used to identify and understand the needs and interests of everyone who has a stake in a project or decision. In the context of purchasing decisions, this can include anyone from the end user to the financial director. The stakeholder analysis can help identify these roles and understand their influence on the purchasing decision.
  - [[Buyer Persona]]
    - This marketing tool involves creating a detailed profile of an ideal customer. This can include their role in the purchasing decision, their needs and wants, and how they would use the product or service. This tool can help businesses understand and cater to the specific roles involved in the purchasing decision.
  - [[Journey Mapping]]
    - Similar to the Customer Journey Map, this tool involves mapping out the entire purchasing process from the customer's perspective. This can help identify the roles of different individuals at each stage of the process, and how they influence the purchasing decision.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can identify how these external factors affect the roles involved in the purchasing decision. For example, legal regulations might dictate who can make certain purchasing decisions in a company.
