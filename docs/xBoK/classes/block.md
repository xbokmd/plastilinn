- ### Definition 
  - A "block" refers to a specific component or element within a business model that can be analyzed and optimized. It can refer to a process, system, or function that contributes to the overall performance of the business. By breaking down the business model into smaller blocks, businesses can identify areas for improvement and make targeted changes to optimize their operations and achieve their goals. Blocks can also be used to visualize and communicate the different components of the business model to stakeholders and team members.
