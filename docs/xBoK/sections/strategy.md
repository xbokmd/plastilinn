- ## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, "strategy" refers to the high-level plan and approach a company takes to achieve its goals and objectives in the face of competition. It is the blueprint that guides the company's decisions and actions, aligning them with its mission, vision, and values. Strategy is a critical component of a business model as it defines the direction and scope of the organization over the long term.
  
  A business strategy typically includes the following elements:
  
  - Strategic Objectives: These are the specific, measurable goals that the company aims to achieve. They provide a clear direction and focus for the organization.
  
  - Competitive Advantage: This refers to the unique value proposition that sets the company apart from its competitors. It could be based on factors such as cost, quality, innovation, customer service, or brand reputation.
  
  - Resource Allocation: A strategy outlines how the company will allocate its resources (such as time, money, and personnel) to achieve its objectives. This includes decisions about investments, budgeting, and staffing.
  
  - Risk Management: A strategy also involves identifying potential risks and challenges and developing plans to mitigate them. This could include market risks, operational risks, financial risks, and more.
  
  For example, a company's strategy might be to become the market leader in its industry by offering innovative, high-quality products, investing heavily in research and development, building a strong brand, and providing exceptional customer service. This strategy would guide the company's decisions about product development, marketing, sales, customer service, and other key areas.

- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "strategy" is not explicitly defined as a separate component, but it is inherently present in all nine components. The strategy is reflected in how these components interact and align to create and deliver value. For example, the value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, key activities, key resources, key partnerships, cost structure, and revenue streams all need to be strategically aligned to ensure the business model's success.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - This strategic planning tool, developed by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, is all about creating uncontested market space (i.e., a "blue ocean") and making the competition irrelevant. The strategy here involves simultaneously pursuing differentiation and low cost to open up a new market space and create new demand.
  - [[Porter's Five Forces]]
    - This tool, developed by Michael E. Porter, is used to analyze the competitive environment of a business. The strategy here involves understanding the five forces (competition in the industry, potential of new entrants into the industry, power of suppliers, power of customers, and threat of substitute products) and positioning the company in a way that it can gain competitive advantage.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to identify and analyze a company's internal strengths and weaknesses, and its external opportunities and threats. The strategy here involves leveraging the company's strengths and opportunities, and addressing its weaknesses and threats to achieve its goals and objectives.
  - [[Balanced Scorecard]]
    - This strategic planning and management system is used to align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. The strategy here involves balancing financial measures with measures of customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization's ability to learn and improve.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - The PESTEL analysis is a tool used to analyze the external macro-environmental factors that affect an organization. The strategy here involves understanding how these factors (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) impact the business and adjusting the business model and strategy accordingly.
