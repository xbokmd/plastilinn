  - ### #[[goal]]
    - #goal [[Define the minimum set of features and experiences that make the product desirable to customers]]
    - #goal [[Focus on delivering the minimum desirable product (MDP) first]]
  - ### Hypothesis
    - By defining and delivering the minimum set of features and experiences that make the product desirable to customers, we will be able to validate the product-market fit and gather feedback for further iterations.

  - ### #[[work]]
    - TODO [[Define the minimum desirable product (MDP)]]
      - Identify the core features and experiences that are essential for the product to be desirable to customers. This could be based on market research, customer feedback, or industry best practices.
    - TODO [[Develop the MDP]]
      - Focus on delivering the identified core features and experiences as the first version of the product. This may involve prioritizing certain features, simplifying the user interface, or streamlining the user experience.
    - TODO [[Gather feedback on the MDP]]
      - Share the MDP with potential customers and gather their feedback on the product. This can be done through user testing, surveys, or interviews.
    - TODO [[Iterate on the product]]
      - Based on the feedback received, iterate on the product to address any issues or areas for improvement. This may involve adding new features, refining existing features, or adjusting the user experience.
    - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
      - Continuously gather feedback on the product and iterate based on the insights gained. This iterative process will help refine the product and ensure that it meets the needs and preferences of the target market.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By defining and delivering the minimum desirable product (MDP), the startup will be able to validate the product-market fit and gather valuable feedback for further iterations. The MDP will provide a solid foundation for the product and ensure that it meets the core needs and preferences of the target market. The expected outcome of this experiment is to refine the product based on the feedback received and increase the chances of success for the startup. Additionally, the startup will build a stronger understanding of the target market and develop relationships with potential customers, which can lead to future partnerships or sales opportunities.
