  - ### #[[goal]]
    - #goal [[Test and validate assumptions with real users]]
    - #goal [[Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core features]]
  - ### Hypothesis
    - By building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core features, we can test and validate our assumptions with real users, gather feedback, and make_informed decisions for further development.

    - TODO [[MVP Development]]
      - TODO [[Define the core features]]
        - Identify the essential features that are necessary for the MVP. These features should address the key problems or pain points of the target market and provide a basic solution.
      - TODO [[Design the user interface]]
        - Create a user-friendly interface for the MVP that allows users to easily navigate and interact with the core features. Consider usability, aesthetics, and user experience in the design process.
      - TODO [[Develop the MVP]]
        - Use appropriate tools and technologies to build the MVP with the defined core features. This could involve coding, prototyping, or using existing software platforms.
      - TODO [[Test the MVP with real users]]
        - Invite real users from the target market to test the MVP and provide feedback. This can be done through user testing sessions, surveys, or beta testing programs.
      - TODO [[Gather feedback and iterate]]
        - Collect feedback from the users on their experience with the MVP. Analyze the feedback and identify areas for improvement or further development. Iterate on the MVP based on the feedback received.
      - TODO [[Validate assumptions]]
        - Use the feedback and data collected from the MVP testing to validate or invalidate the assumptions made during the earlier stages of the business idea. This will help make_informed decisions for the future development of the product or service.
      - TODO [[Plan for further development]]
        - Based on the validated assumptions and feedback from the MVP testing, plan the next steps for further development. This could involve adding new features, refining existing features, or exploring additional market opportunities.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By building an MVP with core features and testing it with real users, the startup will gather valuable feedback and insights. This feedback will help validate or invalidate the assumptions made during the earlier stages of the business idea. The expected outcome of this experiment is to make_informed decisions for further development based on the feedback received. Additionally, the startup will gain a better understanding of the target market's needs and preferences, which will increase the chances of developing a successful and marketable product or service.
