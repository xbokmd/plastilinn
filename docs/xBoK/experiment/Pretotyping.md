      - TODO [[Define the pretotype]]
        - Determine the specific pretotype that will be created to test the business idea. This could be a physical mockup, a landing page, a prototype app, or any other form that allows potential customers to interact with the idea.
      - TODO [[Create the pretotype]]
        - Develop the pretotype using simple and low-cost materials or tools. The focus should be on creating a basic representation of the business idea that can be tested and validated.
      - TODO [[Test the pretotype]]
        - Share the pretotype with potential customers and ask for their feedback. This can be done through in-person demonstrations, online surveys, or other methods of gathering feedback.
      - TODO [[Analyze the feedback]]
        - Review the feedback received from potential customers and identify any insights or patterns. Look for indications of feasibility and desirability, as well as areas for improvement or further development.
      - TODO [[Iterate on the business idea]]
        - Based on the feedback received, make adjustments to the business idea to address any identified issues or opportunities. This may involve refining the product features, adjusting the pricing, or exploring different target markets.
      - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
        - Create and test additional pretotypes to gather more feedback and validate the business idea further. This iterative process will help refine the idea and increase its chances of success.

This feedback will_inform further development and help refine the idea to increase its chances of success. The expected outcome of this experiment is to validate the business idea and identify any necessary adjustments or improvements. Additionally, the startup will gain insights into potential market opportunities and customer preferences, which can guide future decision-making and strategy.
