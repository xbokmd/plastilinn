- ### Definition 
  - an assumption refers to a belief or statement about a certain aspect of the business that is considered to be true, but has not yet been proven or validated. Assumptions are often made when there is insufficient data or evidence available to make a definitive conclusion. These assumptions serve as the foundation for various elements of the business model, such as revenue streams, customer segments, cost structures, and value propositions. It is important for entrepreneurs to identify and test these assumptions to reduce risks and validate their business model.
