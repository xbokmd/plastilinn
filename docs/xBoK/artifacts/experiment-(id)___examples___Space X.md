      - #experiment [[Vertical Integration]]
       Space X adopted a vertically integrated approach, aiming to have control over key components and technologies in-house. By designing and manufacturing a majority of the rocket components themselves, Space X sought to reduce dependence on external suppliers, improve quality control, and accelerate innovation.
       #experiment [[Rocket Engine Development]]
       Space X recognized the importance of reliable and cost-effective rocket engines. To reduce the risk associated with engine development, the company embarked on the ambitious task of designing and manufacturing its engines. This led to the development of the Merlin rocket engine, which powered the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets.
       #experiment [[Rocket Reusability]]
       Recognizing the high cost of expendable rockets, Space X embarked on an experimental journey to develop reusable rocket technology. The company conducted various experiments and tests to land and recover rocket boosters after launch. These experiments resulted in significant advancements, leading to the successful recovery and reuse of Falcon 9 first stages.
       #experiment [[Failure and Learning Culture]]
       Space X adopted a culture that embraced failures as learning opportunities. The company understood that failures were an inherent part of pushing the boundaries of space exploration and technological innovation. Space X actively learned from failures, iterated on designs and processes, and implemented corrective measures to improve future missions.
       #experiment [[Commercial Cargo and Crew Programs]]
       Space X pursued contracts with NASA under the Commercial Cargo and Crew Programs. These programs provided an opportunity for Space X to demonstrate its capabilities and reliability in delivering cargo and eventually crew to the International Space Station. The partnerships with NASA helped Space X refine its processes and gain valuable experience in managing complex missions.
       #experiment [[Incremental Testing and Iterative Development]]
       Space X followed an incremental approach to testing and development, conducting numerous smaller-scale tests and missions before progressing to more ambitious projects. This approach allowed the company to identify and address issues early on, ensuring that subsequent missions had higher chances of success.
