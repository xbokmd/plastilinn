      The pricing for space launch services, satellite deployment, and other offerings can be negotiated based on the specific requirements and needs of the customers.

#price For satellites and spacecraft
The price depends significantly on the payload weight and orbit. For a Falcon 9 launch, prices start around $62 million for payloads up to 22,800 kilograms to low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon Heavy launches, offering more lift capacity, start around $90 million.

#price Deployment into orbit
The cost is included in the launch service pricing. However, for rideshare missions where small satellites share the launch with other payloads, prices can be as low as $1 million for small CubeSats.

#price Supply missions
Under the Commercial Resupply Services contracts with NASA, each mission can cost between $130 million to $150 million, reflecting the specialized nature of these missions and the cargo's value and sensitivity.

#price Human-crewed missions
Pricing for these missions is more complex due to the additional safety measures, life support systems, and training. Under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, a seat on the Crew Dragon to the ISS is approximately $55 million.
