    To calculate the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for SpaceX acquiring a space agency as a client, we must consider various activities and expenses involved in the acquisition process. The CAC is the total cost of sales and marketing efforts required to acquire a new customer, divided by the number of new customers acquired. Here's a hypothetical scenario and calculation:

**Scenario**
SpaceX is aiming to secure a contract with a space agency for a series of satellite launches. The acquisition activities include marketing efforts, proposal preparations, meetings, and negotiation processes.

**Costs**
1. **Marketing and Advertising**: SpaceX invests in targeted marketing campaigns, including industry-specific conferences, online advertising, and promotional materials aimed at space agencies. 
  Estimated Cost: $500,000
2. **Sales Team Expenses**: This includes salaries and commissions for the sales team directly involved in the acquisition process, travel expenses for meetings, and other related costs.
  Estimated Cost: $300,000
3. **Proposal Preparation**: Costs associated with technical staff time spent on preparing the detailed proposal, including feasibility studies, design, and technical specifications.
  Estimated Cost: $200,000
4. **Negotiation and Legal Fees**: Costs for legal consultation during contract negotiation, and other administrative expenses.
  Estimated Cost: $100,000

**Total Acquisition Cost:**
Total Acquisition Cost = $500,000 + $300,000 + $200,000 + $100,000 = $1,100,000

**Number of New Customers Acquired**
For simplicity, let's assume SpaceX successfully secures a contract with 1 space agency in this scenario.

**Calculation of CAC**
CAC = Total Acquisition Cost / Number of New Customers Acquired
CAC =$1,100,000 / 1 = $1,100,000

**Justification:**
The calculated CAC of $1,100,000 represents the estimated cost SpaceX incurs to acquire a new contract with a space agency. Given the high value and long-term nature of contracts in the aerospace sector, this CAC might be justified as the revenue and strategic value derived from such a contract could far exceed the initial acquisition cost. Moreover, the relationship established through this acquisition could lead to further contracts and collaborations, enhancing the overall value obtained from the initial investment.
