  - ### #[[work]]
    - TODO [[Create a landing page]]
      - Design and develop a landing page that effectively communicates the value proposition of the business idea and encourages visitors to provide their contact_information. The landing page should have a clear call-to-action and a form to capture the contact details.
    - TODO [[Set up analytics tracking]]
      - Implement analytics tracking on the landing page to measure the number of visitors, the conversion rate, and other relevant metrics. This can be done using tools like Google Analytics or other website analytics platforms.
    - TODO [[Drive traffic to the landing page]]
      - Promote the landing page through various channels to drive traffic and generate leads. This can be done through social media advertising, search engine optimization, content marketing, or other marketing strategies.
    - TODO [[Measure the conversion rate]]
      - Monitor the analytics data to track the number of visitors to the landing page and the number of conversions (i.e., visitors who provide their contact_information). Calculate the conversion rate by dividing the number of conversions by the number of visitors and multiply by 100 to get a percentage.
    - TODO [[Analyze the data]]
      - Review the analytics data and analyze the conversion rate. Look for insights on the effectiveness of the landing page and identify areas for improvement. This analysis will help optimize the landing page and increase the conversion rate.
    - TODO [[Optimize the landing page]]
      - Based on the analysis of the data, make changes to the landing page to improve its effectiveness in generating leads. This could involve adjusting the design, modifying the copy, or optimizing the call-to-action.
    - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
      - Continuously monitor and optimize the landing page to improve the conversion rate over time. Test different variations of the landing page and measure their performance to identify the most effective design and messaging.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By creating a landing page with a form to capture contact_information and measuring the conversion rate, we expect to generate leads and gain insights into the effectiveness of the page. This experiment will help us understand how well the landing page is converting visitors into leads and identify areas for improvement. The expected outcome is to optimize the landing page and increase the conversion rate, ultimately driving more leads and potential customers for the business.
