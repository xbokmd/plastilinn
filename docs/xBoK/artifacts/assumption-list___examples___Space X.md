    - #assumption [[Cost reduction through reusable rockets]]
     One of the main assumptions on which Space X operates is that the development and use of reusable rocket technology will significantly reduce the cost of space exploration and transportation. By recovering and reusing rocket boosters, Space X aims to reduce the expenses associated with building new rockets for each mission.
     #assumption [[Reliability of reusable rockets]]
     Space X assumes that its reusable rockets, such as the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, can maintain high levels of reliability and performance in multiple launches. This assumption is crucial to their cost-saving strategy, as successful rocket recovery and reuse are key to reducing overall mission costs.
     #assumption [[Technological advancements]]
     Space X assumes that continuous technological advancements and innovation will improve their launch systems and spacecraft, allowing them to push the boundaries of space exploration. They invest in research and development to enhance the design of their rockets, propulsion systems, and landing capabilities.
     #assumption [[Demand for commercial space services]]
     Space X assumes that there is a growing and sustained demand for commercial space services, including satellite launches, cargo resupply missions, and manned missions. Their goal is to capture a significant portion of the market by offering reliable and cost-effective solutions to meet this demand.
     #assumption [[Collaboration with space agencies]]
     Space X assumes that collaboration with space agencies, such as NASA and international counterparts, will provide opportunities for partnerships, contracts, and joint missions. This assumption is based on the belief that collaboration with established space agencies can enhance their credibility and open avenues for additional funding and support.
     #assumption [[Operational efficiency]]
     Space X assumes that they can continuously improve operational efficiency and optimize their processes to reduce costs and ensure reliable mission execution. This includes manufacturing processes, on-site launch operations, supply chain management, and quality control measures.
