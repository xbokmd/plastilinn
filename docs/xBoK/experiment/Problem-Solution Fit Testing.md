    - TODO [[Problem-Solution Fit Testing]]
      - TODO [[Define success criteria]]
        - Clearly define the criteria that will determine whether the proposed solution effectively solves the identified problem and provides value to customers. This could include metrics such as customer satisfaction, adoption rate, or revenue generated.
      - TODO [[Develop a testing plan]]
        - Create a plan for testing the problem-solution fit, including the specific methods, tools, and resources that will be used. This could involve conducting user tests, running pilot programs, or collecting feedback from early adopters.
      - TODO [[Implement the testing plan]]
        - Execute the testing plan by implementing the defined methods and collecting data on the performance of the proposed solution. This could involve observing user behavior, conducting surveys or interviews, or analyzing usage data.
      - TODO [[Analyze the results]]
        - Review the data collected during the testing phase and analyze the results against the defined success criteria. Look for patterns, trends, and insights that indicate whether the proposed solution effectively solves the identified problem and provides value to customers.
      - TODO [[Iterate on the solution]]
        - Based on the analysis of the results, make adjustments or improvements to the proposed solution to better address the identified problem and provide more value to customers. This could involve refining features, adjusting pricing, or enhancing the user experience.
      - TODO [[Re-test the solution]]
        - Conduct additional testing to validate the effectiveness of the adjusted solution. This could involve running another round of user tests, piloting the solution with a larger group of customers, or collecting feedback from a wider audience.
      - TODO [[Evaluate the results]]
        - Evaluate the results of the re-testing phase and compare them to the initial results. Determine whether the adjustments made to the solution have improved its problem-solution fit and value to customers.
  - ### Expected outcome
    - By conducting problem-solution fit testing, we expect to validate that the proposed solution effectively solves the identified problem and provides value to customers. This validation will increase confidence in the business idea and improve the chances of success. Additionally, it will provide valuable insights for further iterations and improvements to the solution. The expected outcome of this experiment is to have a refined and validated solution that meets the needs of the target market and has a high potential for success in the market.
