        - Define the specific group of potential customers that the business idea aims to serve. This could be based on demographics, psychographics, or specific industry verticals.
      - TODO [[Prepare interview questions]]
        - Develop a set of open-ended questions that will help us understand the problems, pain points, and needs of the target market segment. These questions should be designed to encourage participants to share their experiences and challenges.
      - TODO [[Recruit participants]]
        - Reach out to potential customers within the target market segment and invite them to participate in the problem interviews. This can be done through various channels such as social media, online forums, or personal networks.
      - TODO [[Conduct the problem interviews]]
        - Schedule one-on-one interviews with the recruited participants. During the interviews, ask the prepared questions and actively listen to their responses. Encourage participants to provide detailed examples and anecdotes to gain deeper insights.
      - TODO [[Take detailed notes]]
        - Record the participants' responses, paying attention to common themes, recurring problems, and unmet needs. Note any interesting or unexpected insights that may arise during the interviews.
      - TODO [[Analyze the data]]
        - Review the collected data and identify patterns, trends, and key findings. Look for common pain points and needs that are consistently mentioned by the participants. This analysis will help validate the problem-solution fit and provide valuable_information for further iterations of the business idea.
      - TODO [[Adjust the business idea]]
        - Based on the insights gained from the problem interviews, refine the business idea to better address the identified problems, pain points, and needs of the target market segment. This may involve pivoting the value proposition, adjusting the target market segment, or exploring additional features or services.
      - TODO [[Repeat the process]]
        - Conduct problem interviews with a larger sample of potential customers to validate the findings and gather more insights. Iterate on the business idea based on the feedback received.
  - ### Expected Outcome
    - By conducting problem interviews, we expect to gain a deeper understanding of the target market segment's problems, pain points, and needs. This will validate the problem-solution fit and provide valuable insights for refining the business idea. Additionally, it will help identify potential market opportunities and guide further iterations of the business model. Ultimately, this experiment will increase the chances of developing a successful and sustainable startup.
