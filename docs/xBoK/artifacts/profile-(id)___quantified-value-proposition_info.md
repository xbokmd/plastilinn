- ## üìñ Description
  The concept of "Profile (ID)/Quantified Value Proposition" in business modeling is an argumentation based on metrics of the amount of value that the user receives when using a company's solution. It is a strategic tool used to communicate the unique value that a product or service provides to its target audience, quantified in terms of specific benefits.
  
  In this model, businesses use various tools and techniques to gather and analyze data about the value their solution provides. This could involve conducting user research, analyzing market research and user data, and measuring the impact of their solution on key performance indicators (KPIs). The goal is to quantify the value proposition in a way that is meaningful and compelling to the target audience.
  
  For example, a cloud storage company might quantify its value proposition by stating that its solution increases productivity by 30%, reduces costs by 50%, and improves data security by 90%. These figures are based on metrics that the company has measured, such as the time saved by using their solution, the cost savings achieved, and the reduction in data breaches.
  
  Alternatively, a fitness app might quantify its value proposition by stating that users who use their app for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, see an average weight loss of 10 pounds in 3 months. These figures are based on user data and research, and provide a clear and compelling argument for the value of the app.
  
  The "Profile (ID)/Quantified Value Proposition" concept in business modeling is crucial because it helps businesses to communicate the unique value of their solution in a way that is meaningful and compelling to their target audience. This can lead to increased user adoption, satisfaction, and loyalty, and ultimately, business success.

- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Value Proposition" is a key component that describes the unique value a company offers to its customers. This value is often quantified in terms of benefits minus cost. It's crucial to understand the customer profile (id) to tailor the value proposition to meet their specific needs and expectations.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is an extension of the Business Model Canvas. It focuses specifically on the value proposition and customer segment components. The tool helps businesses to design compelling value propositions by understanding the customer's needs and delivering quantified value.
  - [[Lean Startup Methodology]]
    - The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, emphasizes the importance of getting customer feedback during the early stages of a business. This feedback is used to refine the value proposition, ensuring it delivers quantified value that meets the customer's needs.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - This strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, encourages businesses to create new market space (or "blue oceans") where competition is irrelevant. The strategy involves delivering a leap in value for both the company and its customers. The quantified value proposition is a key component of this strategy.
  - [[Jobs-to-be-Done Framework]]
    - This framework, developed by Clayton Christensen, focuses on understanding the customer's "job" ‚Äì the progress they are trying to make in a particular circumstance. The framework helps businesses to design value propositions that help customers get their "job" done more effectively or efficiently, providing a clear quantification of value.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - While SWOT analysis is a more general tool, it can be used to evaluate the strength of a company's value proposition. A strong, quantified value proposition can be a significant strength, while a weak or unclear value proposition can be a major weakness. Opportunities and threats in the market can also impact the value proposition.
  - [[PESTEL Analysis]]
    - This tool can help businesses understand how external factors may impact their value proposition. For example, technological advancements may enable a company to deliver more value to its customers, while legal changes may restrict how a company can deliver value.
