- ## üìñ Description
  In business modeling, the concept of "profile (id)/value proposition" refers to the unique combination of products or services that a company offers to meet the specific needs of a particular customer segment. It is the unique value that a company promises to deliver to its customers, and the reason why customers should choose this company over its competitors. 
  
  The profile (id)/value proposition is a critical component of business design as it defines the company's competitive advantage, shapes its business strategy, and drives its business operations. It is the foundation of a company's relationship with its customers and the key to its market success.
  
  For instance, a software company may offer a unique value proposition to its business customers by providing innovative, reliable, and user-friendly software solutions that help businesses improve their productivity, reduce their costs, and grow their revenues. The company may also offer superior customer service, technical support, and training to ensure that its customers can fully utilize its software and achieve their business goals.
  
  The software company's value proposition is not just about its software. It is about the total value that the company delivers to its customers, including the quality of its software, the benefits that its software brings to its customers, and the support that the company provides to its customers. It is about how the company solves its customers' problems, meets their needs, and creates value for them.
  
  In essence, the profile (id)/value proposition is a strategic tool that enables businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, attract and retain their customers, and achieve their business goals. It is the heart of business design and a key driver of business success.

- ## üß∞ Tools
  - [[Business Model Canvas]]
    - In the Business Model Canvas, the "Value Proposition" is one of the nine key components. It refers to the unique combination of products and services that a company offers to its customers. The value proposition should be designed in a way that it solves a problem or fulfills a need of the customer, making it the main reason for a customer to choose one company over another.
  - [[Value Proposition Canvas]]
    - This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is specifically designed to help businesses understand their customers' needs and design a value proposition that meets those needs. It consists of two parts: the customer profile and the value map. The customer profile describes the jobs, pains, and gains of a specific customer segment, while the value map describes how the company's products and services create value for this customer segment.
  - [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
    - The Blue Ocean Strategy is a business theory that suggests companies are better off searching for ways to play in uncontested market spaces (Blue Oceans) rather than competing with similar businesses in an existing industry (Red Oceans). One of the key tools in this strategy is the "Value Curve", which is a graphical depiction of a company's relative performance across its industry's factors of competition. This tool can help a company to design a unique value proposition that differentiates it from its competitors.
  - [[SWOT Analysis]]
    - The SWOT analysis can also be used to evaluate a company's value proposition. Strengths and weaknesses can highlight aspects of the value proposition that are working well or need improvement, while opportunities and threats can identify external factors that could affect the value proposition in the future.
  - [[Jobs to be Done]]
    - This theory, developed by Clayton Christensen, suggests that customers hire products and services to do specific jobs. By understanding what job a customer needs to get done, a company can design a value proposition that perfectly fits this job. This approach can lead to highly differentiated and customer-centric value propositions.
