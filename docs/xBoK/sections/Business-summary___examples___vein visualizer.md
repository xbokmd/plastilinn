  - The company behind the Vein Viewer, an innovative medical device, developed a business model that focuses on addressing the medical needs of patients and the clinical workforce.
   The Vein Viewer is designed to locate veins in patients, especially in cases where it's challenging due to obesity or other factors. This is known as difficult venous access (DVA).
   The device is particularly useful in reducing the pain and complications that patients experience during needle sticks for vascular access.
   One of the significant innovations of the Vein Viewer is its high-definition imaging and advanced digital full field technology.
   It uses a reflective, infrared technology, emitting harmless LED light, which is absorbed by the blood and reflected by surrounding tissues.
   This technology allows medical professionals to easily locate veins, understanding the patient's blood pattern up to 15 mm deep, with 10 mm being sufficient for medical purposes.
   It prevents patients from receiving accidental punctures during attempts to find veins and projects an image of the patient’s vasculature with exact anatomical locations.
   This not only ensures a safer procedure of vascular access for patients and healthcare workers but also represents a significant advancement in medical science.
   For the business model, the company used the Business Model Canvas as a tool for launching the Vein Viewer Flex to the market.
   The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that provides a visual framework for developing, describing, and analyzing a company's business model, including key partners, activities, resources, value propositions, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue streams.
   This tool was chosen for its capability to manage multiple aspects of model development in a well-structured manner​1​.
